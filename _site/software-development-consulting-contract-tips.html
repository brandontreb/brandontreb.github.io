  <h1>Software Development Consulting: Some Tips On Structuring Your Contracts</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    
    <p>When I first started out as an independent software developer, one of things that stressed me out the most was how to structure contracts that I sent to clients. Â Working for a consultancy in my previous work-life I had seen contracts before, however, I never really paid enough attention to them to know what type of content went into them.</p>

<p>After quite a bit of research, I found an invaluable resource. Â Over at techrepublic.com, Chip Camden posted a beautifully crafted consulting contract template. Â You can see the post and download the template <a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/it-consultant/customizable-it-consultant-sample-contract/">here</a>. Â This post was a lifesaver.</p>

<p>Chip goes over EVERY single section of the contract and gives an explanation of why itâ€™s there. Â You can download the template and determine which sections you need for your business, based on his explanations. Â It doesnâ€™t get much easier than that. Â Of course, I would still strongly suggest you fork over a couple hundred bucks and have a lawyer look over the contract before sending it off to clients.</p>

<h4 id="how-to-sign-contracts-online">How To Sign Contracts Online</h4>

<p>Once you have your contract in place, you will need a way to get your clients to sign it. Â You could go the old-fashioned way of scanning, both parties signing, and scanning again OR you could use an online signature service. Â One that I use and highly recommend is <a href="https://rightsignature.com">RightSignature</a>. I know those guys personally and have had a great experience with the service so far.</p>

<h4 id="here-is-my-process">Here is my process:</h4>

<p>This is what I have found works out well for my business. Â #proTip: I have my assistant do this now ðŸ˜‰</p>

<ol>
  <li>Complete the contract blanks in regards to rates or any other information you want the client to see before they sign the contract.</li>
  <li>Upload the contract template to Google Drive (optional). Â Make sure your company info is completed and all of the other fields (dates, signatures, etcâ€¦) are blanked out.</li>
  <li>Once inside of your RightSignature account, you can connect to your Google Drive and import the document in. Â You can also upload them directly from your computer if you donâ€™t want to use Google Drive.</li>
  <li>RightSignature lets you put text fields and date boxes in the blanks and specify who is responsible for filling them out (you or the client).</li>
  <li>Finally, add the signature fields at the bottom and send off the document for signing.</li>
  <li>Once every party has filled out the needed information, the completed document is then sent to both parties via email.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="other-considerations">Other Considerations</h4>

<p>Often times, the client will have their own contracts for you to sign. Â This isnâ€™t necessarily a bad thing. Â However, make sure that you read over it carefully and run it by your lawyer. Â Donâ€™t try to force your contract on a client that already has their own. Â They will usually not be open to this, in my experience.</p>

<p>Make sure to have an â€˜exit clauseâ€™ in your contract in case things go sour. Â I seldom enter into fixed bid contracts so I usually have a clause where either party can cancel the contract with 7 days written notice. Â This also makes the client feel at ease as they are not trapped with you in an event where their situation changes.</p>

<p>Finally, be willing to be flexible. Â Sometimes clients might not like certain clauses in your contract. Â Be willing to change things like delivery dates, invoice dates, invoice periods, rates, etcâ€¦ on a client to client basis. Â Obviously, use your best judgement here.</p>

<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>

<p>I hope that you have found this post useful and it saves you some time hunting down a contract template. Â I am always open to suggestions so if you see anything else that works for you, I would love to hear about it via email or in the comments.</p>
