  <h1>2016 Goals</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    
    <p>As the new year kicks off in full swing, I am reflecting on <a href="http://brandontreb.com/goals-for-2015/">my 2015 goals</a> and setting some new ones for 2016.</p>

<p>Here is how I did on each of last year’s goals:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Create a business plan</strong> - <span style="color: #993300;">Fail</span>. I did not create a business plan for Pixegon.  This might have to carry over.</li>
    <li><strong>Grow Pixegon (my mobile consultancy) to 2x 2014 revenue</strong> - <span style="color: #008000;">Success</span>. We not only achieved this goal, but surpassed it. Pixegon did a total of $1.1mm in revenue in 2015!</li>
    <li><strong>Hire a “director” - </strong><span style="color: #008000;">Success</span>. OK, so this one is sort of in the middle. I didn't quite hire a director per se, however I did elevate my senior employees to more management roles. This allows them to take some of the day to day tasks off of my plate.</li>
    <li><strong>Move to a weekly - </strong><span style="color: #993300;">Fail</span>. But I'm OK with it. This isn't very important.</li>
    <li><strong>Morning Routine</strong> - <span style="color: #ffcc00;">Moderate</span>. Some days were better than others</li>
    <li><strong>Blog twice a month - </strong><span style="color: #993300;">Huge Fail</span>.  I averaged .41 times per month.</li>
    <li><strong>Take off / reduce workload - </strong><span style="color: #008000;">Success</span>. More camping!</li>
    <li><strong>Give away more than 10% of personal income - </strong><span style="color: #008000;">Success</span>. Our family was blessed with multiple opportunities throughout the year to be a blessing to others in addition to our normal donations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, I’d call 2015 a success. I managed to hit the goals I felt most passionate about, and more importantly, this exercise has helped me to determine what I should focus on.  With that being said here are my goals for 2016.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Professional</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Land <strong>ONE</strong> new client.  Sounds crazy I know, but allow me to explain.  Pixegon has been fortunate enough to work with some <a href="http://www.pixegon.com/more-works">pretty incredible clients</a>.  Many of these clients trust us to be their primary dev team throughout the year. I intend on finding at least ONE more client like these in 2016 (Referrals welcome ;) ).</li>
    <li>Build Something New. As I continue to build a company, it's often hard to get back to my roots of writing code and actually creating something. I miss this. It provided so much value to me over the course of the years. So, this year, I want build some "side projects".</li>
    <li>Hire. I hope to grow the team by at least 20% this year.  (<a href="http://www.pixegon.com/join-our-team/">We are always hiring most positions</a>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
    <li><strong>Personal</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Be more intentional about EVERYTHING.  I have really been into a few blogs lately (<a href="http://www.mrmoneymustache.com">Mr Money Mustache</a>, <a href="http://www.theminimalists.com">The Minimalists</a>, <a href="http://fourhourworkweek.com/blog/">4-Hour Workweek</a>, etc...).  What I have really learned is that I want to be more intentional about everything I do (Family, Time, Money, etc...).  Part of this is removing my dependency on my phone, simplifying my life, and scheduling undivided time for the things that are important.</li>
    <li>Stop Complaining. I read this incredible book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0770436390/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0770436390&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=codnerandnon-20&amp;linkId=JCWEFBN6BTYDX2OC" rel="nofollow">A Complaint Free World</a> . He talks about the power of Not complaining. This has really resonated with me.</li>
    <li>Blog Twice Per Month. OK This time I mean it (1 down, 23 to go! )</li>
    <li>Read 5 books. Arbitrary amount I know, but I need something measurable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s it. Here’s to a healthy and productive 2016!</p>
