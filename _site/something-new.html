<p>Every single year since the beginning of time (at least since the beginning of this blog), I have resolved to “blog more”.  And every single year, I have absolutely failed at that.</p>

<p>So, in favor of <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/set-goals-not-resolutions-tim-ferriss-2016-12">systems over resolutions</a>, I am attempting to do something different this year.  Over the holiday, I blogged 12 posts related to my experiences as an independent software developer as well as business owner that I feel could benefit the community.  These share everything from selling contracts to hiring friends, mistakes made, and more.</p>

<p>I plan on releasing one post a month on the first Monday of every month.  Given that I already have these posts written, it <em>should</em> be a no-brainer to blog consistently. I also intend on writing in-between posts, but at this point that’s probably wishful thinking.</p>

<p>If you have any interest in this sort of thing (software development consulting), then be sure to add yourself to the <a href="http://brandontreb.us3.list-manage1.com/subscribe?u=66135759856eefe4f6dcec97c&amp;id=ef6c358d78">mailing list</a>.</p>

<p>Wishing you a successful and exciting 2017.</p>

<p><strong>Cheers!</strong></p>
