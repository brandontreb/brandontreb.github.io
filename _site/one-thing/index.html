  <div class="e-content">
    <p>I was recently listening to <a href="https://overcast.fm/+KebuxnetQ">Episode 344- 10 Strategies To Be Happier Through Gratitude</a> on the Tim Ferris Show. Oddly enough, I much prefer episodes where Tim is absent. I do love him, but sometimes feels he steals the conversation.</p>

<p>Anyway, the episode was hosted by a guy named A.J. Jacobs. Jacobs <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thanks-Thousand-Gratitude-Journey-Books/dp/1501119923">wrote a book on gratitude</a> and is known for traveling the world to thank over 1,000 people involved in his morning coffee (think farmer, roaster, truck driver, etc…).</p>

<p>While I loved the episode, there was something super interesting that I took from it. Jacobs keeps a notebook where he writes down just <em>one thing</em> that he takes away from every book, podcast, and blog.</p>

<p>I love this idea. Often, I will read something, get super inspired, only to forget about it and never apply it.</p>

<p>I feel that this is a great strategy and think it will make for an interesting post on this blog every so often. Think of it as mini book/podcast/blog reviews that highlight what I found to be important.</p>

<p>So my “one thing” from that episode is to start writing down the “one things” from other pieces of media.</p>
