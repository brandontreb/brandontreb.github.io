  <h1>Lua Scripting The UI For Pocket MUD Pro</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    
    <p>I have just updated my MUD client [<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pocket-mud-pro/id511678455?mt=8">Pocket MUD Pro</a>] to be a universal library. It was surprisingly easy to add the iPad support as most of the application was comprised of UITableViews.</p>

<p>The main “MUD” view was the most challenging part as it contains a couple UIWebViews, UIButons, and a UITextField. However, I chose to do something I feel is pretty cool.</p>

<h4 id="scripting-the-ui-with-lua">Scripting The UI With Lua</h4>

<p>If I haven’t said it enough, I love lua. Especially in the context of scripting within other applications. Pocket MUD Pro already has complete lua support in triggers in aliases, so I figured I might as well apply that same logic to the UI.</p>

<p>Pocket MUD Pro has 3 core sections for the UI not counting the text input field. The main view (UIWebview), the prompt view (UIWebview), and the button bar (custom UIView).</p>

<p>One of the core challenges I faced on the iPhone, was resizing/reorienting all of these views on orientation change as well as when the keyboard was visible and when it wasn’t. To be honest, I spent most of my cycles getting this part right. On the iPad, I decided to things a little differently which improved the speed of my development overall and paved the way for future updates that will allow user-scripted UIs.</p>

<h4 id="the-ui-script">The UI Script</h4>

<p>I want to start by showing you the lua code that is used to script the UI by default.</p>

<div>
  <pre><code class="’lua’">–MUD 
mudFrame = Frame:new(&quot;mud_frame&quot;) 
mudFrame.type = FrameTypeMUD
mudFrame.portraitFrame = {0,0,768,931}
mudFrame.portraitFrameKeyboard = {0,0,768,667}
mudFrame.landscapeFrame = {0,0,1024,675}
mudFrame.landscapeFrameKeyboard = {0,0,1024,323}
createFrame(mudFrame)</code></pre>
</div>

<p>What’s happening here is, I have created a Frame class that has some properties (type, name, etc…) and injected it into the global lua space for use inside of the UIScripts. Then when the interface gets drawn, I reference the UI script for each of the MUD servers and use it to render the interface.</p>

<p>One interesting thing here is, I set the frames for each of the possible layout scenarios. Portrait, Landscape, with and without the keyboard. That way, when the keyboard hides/dismisses or the user rotates the device, I just reference the this script again and re-render the frame accordingly. This could have been achieved with auto-resizing masks however, it gets much more complex and things get tricky when you want to have a dynamic number of windows.</p>

<p>I follow this exact pattern for the button frames and the prompt frames. As you might have guessed, in a future release, I will open this script area up to MUDders and give the user the ability to script the interface however they would like. Some examples might be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dedicated map window</li>
  <li>Dedicated chat window</li>
  <li>Customized movement buttons</li>
  <li>Customized backgrounds/borders/themes</li>
  <li>Custom health/status/mana</li>
</ul>

<p>Given this powerful UI Scripting style, a user will be able to create complex interfaces such as the one below from inside the app:</p>

<p>I still have a ways to go with exposing various functionalities via my custom lua bridge. But things seem to be moving along quite smoothly.</p>

<p>If you want to learn how I was able to bridge lua into my application, consider checking out my talk on lua scripting at <a href="http://360idev.com/">360iDev 2012</a> later this year!</p>

<p>Happy Coding!</p>
