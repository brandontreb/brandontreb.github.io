    <p>I was having a conversation with my dad the other day and sharing some of my current business ideas with him.  I also mentioned that I often discuss new product/business ideas in public with other people.</p>

<p>His response was obviously “Why would you just give away your ideas?”.  I then proceeded to give him the "Your Ideas Are Worthless Without Proper Execution” spiel.</p>

<p>So, to put my money where my mouth is, I will be sharing my business ideas here; putting them out there in hopes that either a. I get valuable feedback/encouragement or b. someone else builds it and I get to use it.</p>

<p><strong>Business idea</strong></p>

<p>So many people have RVs that are in use roughly 5% on the year.  The other 95% of the time, they sit in disrepair and usually cost the owner money to store them.</p>

<p>While many sites like <a href="https://rvshare.com/">RVShare</a> exist that allow you to essentially "rent out" your RV, they still pose a huge challenge in that the RV must be physically located on the owner's property.</p>

<p>I propose to build an RV storage facility where owners receive the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Free Storage</li>
  <li>Free basic upkeep</li>
  <li>Free cleaning</li>
  <li>Profit Sharing</li>
  <li>Insurance</li>
</ol>

<p>In exchange for this, they allow us to rent their RV out at a price we set.  It would function much like RVShare in that would-be RVers reserve one of the RVs we have in our fleet and come pick it up. The RV would be ready to go with a full tank of water, full propane tanks, and a generator.</p>

<p>Once they return the RV, it gets cleaned and prepped for the next renter. Profits from the rental would be shared with the RV owner.</p>

<p>There you have it. I'd love to <a href="http://twitter.com/brandontreb">hear your thoughts</a> and I hope to be sharing more of these in the future.</p>
