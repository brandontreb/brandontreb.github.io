    <p>Over the past few months, I have had the pleasure of working on a <a href="http://thisorthat.io">DApp called thisorthat.io</a> built on the Ethereum network.  It has been an absolute blast.  I have had so much fun building the smart contracts as well as the React front-end interface.</p>

<p>I truly believe there is a huge future here, and it can be especially lucrative for developers/startup teams.  If you look at <a href="https://dappradar.com/">Dapp Radar</a>, you can see that many of the top DApps have less than 1,000 DAU (daily active users).  If you consider how much money is being made, crypto-users end up being <strong>much more</strong> valuable than users on any other platform.</p>

<p>Take for example, <a href="https://www.cryptokitties.co/">Crypto Kitties</a>. It's basically a mix of Beanie Babies and Tamagatchis. According to DApp Radar, 380 ETH (or $255K USD) has moved through their platform in the past 7 days <strong>with only 652 daily active users!!!</strong>. This is absolutely insane.</p>

<p>It's not all sunshine and rainbows though.  After spending 80+ hours working on a crypto-centric app, I believe I have some insight into some pain points that will need to be solved before these types of apps are to be widely adopted.</p>

<p>In my next post, I will discuss some of the hurdles preventing DApps from going mainstream.  There is so much room for improvement and innovation in this space, I feel that all devs should be looking at crypto like we looked at mobile dev in 2008.</p>

<p>To the moon!</p>
