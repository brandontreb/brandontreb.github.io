    <p>I always receive cold emails. Some of them are personalized, and some of them are robotic. Sometimes, I’ll ignore and sometimes I’ll respond with something snarky (this is my spiritual gift). I get it. These are just part of the internet.</p>

<p>Whenever I get a cold email from someone local, it’s a different story.  I always feel sorry for them. They have totally missed an opportunity to connect with someone in <em>real life</em> and possibly a sale.</p>

<p>These are the emails in which I’ll generally reply with some practical advice.</p>

<p><strong>If you are desiring to cold email people in your area</strong></p>

<p>Rather than emailing “Dear Brandon, I really think your business could benefit from our website services.”, you should <strong>always</strong> do at least 5 seconds of research.</p>

<p>Start by saying “Brandon, I really loved your post on Staying Fit With 3 Kids, I’d love to buy you coffee and pick your brain”. This shows you are interested and care about them at a human level (which you should anyway) and greatly increases the chances of them buying the services you are selling.</p>

<p>At worst, you will have connected with a likeminded individual who could/would potentially refer others to you in the future. At best, you could get all of the above plus a new customer and friend.</p>

<p>So, the next time you are cold emailing someone who’s within driving distance from you, give this post another read and consider a more personal approach.</p>
