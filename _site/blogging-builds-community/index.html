    <p>It's been around 3 weeks since I started <a href="http://www.brandontreb.com/on-blogging-more-frequently.html">blogging every weekday</a>.  This experience has been nothing short of delightful.</p>

<p>While I have seen many improvements in my communication (written and verbal), I believe the best benefit is around the community.</p>

<p>When I started blogging in 2008, my posts used to have upwards of 100 comments. Granted I was a renegade blogging about iOS in a time of Apple's dreaded NDA. I absolutely <strong>loved</strong> the feedback and the community that was forming around my writing.  I have been blogging on and off since then and have never felt that same spark.</p>

<p>This all changed, when I made a commitment to writing daily short-form blog posts and posting them to <a href="https://micro.blog/brandontreb">micro.blog</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/brandontreb">twitter</a>.  I began to receive comments, and these comments turned into <em>real</em> discussions.</p>

<p>This has been a blast as I'm now able to connect with so many wonderful people in the community.  We are sharing thoughts and ideas and challenging each other’s beliefs on tech, business, etc…</p>

<p>So, I challenge you. If you are on the fence, just stop worrying about the quality/frequency/etc… of your writing and just write.  And once you have written, share it with others.  I promise you, the community you will build is worth it!</p>
