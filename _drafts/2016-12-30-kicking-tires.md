Kicking The Tires Of Software Development Consulting - How To Try It Before You Buy It

Being your own boss is one of the most liberating and fun ways one can possibly work.  It comes with it's own set of challenges however they are greatly outweighed by the bennefits.

One of the most common questions I get in my day to day is "How do I become a software developer consultant?".  People want to know where to start, how to find clients, etc... Although I have written extensively on some of these topics, I have found one solid way to get started that can really ease your "jump" to freelance.

#### Start by contracting with a consultancy 

Consultancies such as [mine](http://pixegon.com) LOVE to hire consultants when they have an overflow of work.  For us, hiring a new W2 developer is quite the commitment in time, money, relationships, etc... so we need to be serious when we hire a new full time employee.

However, there are many times when we have WAY more work that we can handle.  It would be foolish of us to just hire any time we were in a **peak** given that a **valley** ususally follows some time after. So, when we need to scale up quickly, we often hire 1099 contractors to help with the additional workload.  Although we might pay quite a bit more for their time, the tradeoff is they can move on when the work has been completed.

## 1. Starts building your portfolio

Selling contracts is hard.  Especially when you don't have a personal portfolio.  Often times teams are more likely to hire you for your skills rather than your portfolio if they know you are coming off of a W2 position.  

This is especially great if you possess a skillset that the team doesn't already have. (i.e. a webshop hiring you for your mobile experience).

## 2. Potentially longer term contracts

From my previous experience, as long as you continue providing value to a team, they will continue to keep you on as long as they have work.  This usually results in longer term contracts with greater consistency.

When I first started out consulting, I joined a team as their iOS developer (on contract).  After a while I remember lementing to my peers that I no longer felt like an entrapeneur and that I felt no different than when working for a larger company.

One of my friends remeinded me that the difference is the relationship.  If you use this time wisely to expand out beyond this team, leveraging it's safety to sell more of your own contracts, then you are well on your way to fully becoming independant.


## 3. Great way to connect with other clients

One client leads to more clients.  If you are doing a great job for someone, chances are your work will be noticed.  Peopel are always asking around for "good devlopers" and if you have a great relationship with your client, chances are they will recommend you when that question gets asked of them.

Another great thing to do along these lines is ask your exisitng clients "who else can you introduce me to?". You will be suprised as they spout off a list of warm leads that they will introduce you to.

## 4. Possible follow up work in the future

Here we are almost 4.5 years after I went independent and I still do some work for clients I had on day 1.  That's because I was able to form long lasting relationships with them and their teams.  They know when they need "iOS work", they can always call me up.  It's no longer me personally doing the work, but they now trust me to send someone who is just as capable in getting the work done.

Having this recurring work is key to your success in waivoring the aforementioned valleys.
