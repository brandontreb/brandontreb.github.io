title: Ways A Consultant Can Appear Larger Than They Are

I have been doing iOS development consulting for over 8 years now. Since day 1 of the iOS SDK, I couldn't help but build mobile software. Over the course of my career, I often missed out on opportunities given that I was just an indie and didn't represent a full blown software agency.

In this post, I will share some reasons to appear one way or the other as well as some tips I used to appear larger than I actually was in the early days.

## Main Reasons To Appear As An Indie

Don't get me wrong, there are quite a few situations where being an indie software developer is vastly superior to a software shop.  A few of these reasons might be:

##### When the client has a tight budget

A full stop software team has a perceived higher cost than indies. That's because they may have more overhead (physical space, HR, project management, etc...).  So, when a client is trying to spin up a quick project or MVP, hiring a lone wolf dev appears to be much more cost effective (though that's not always the case).

##### When the client has their own development team

If a client has their own development team, but has a gap in knowlege (say mobile), they will often look for a freelance consultant to temporarily fill the role.

At [Pixegon](http://pixegon.com), we offer staff augmentation for this type of scenario, however many dev shops are not set up to "lend out" their development resources. These types are roles a fanstastic for the freelance developer. 

##### A developer is local to the where the client resides

If a client doesn't live in a larger city, chances are they will be hardpressed to find a develpment team that can help the solve their problem.  So as a freelance developer, your best bet is always to search locally for development work.

## Main Reasons To Appear As A Larger Team

Over the years, I feel that I have missed out on quite a few larger clients due to being and "indie".  Although I had the chops to help the client solve their problem, there are a number of reasons why they wanted a "software shop".

##### Perceived lack of expertise 

These days, anyone can call themselves a freelance software developer. And, skillsets range from someone who just took their first Udemy course all the way up to PHDs in computer science with decades of experience.  When clients are shopping for a developer or a team to work with, it's usually a real crap shoot.  Appearing as a company can make you seem like you really  know what you are doing.  

##### It won't seem like you will dissapear

"Our developer won't return my calls".  I get these sales calls all of the time.  Freelance developers stopping suddenly on a project without notice. This usually leaves the client in a desparate sitation having sunk quite a bit of money into their product.  

##### The ability to offer more than just your core skillset

Early on, I hired contractors all of the time. However, I never referred to them as my contractors rather my **team**.  The client doesn't care about the tax constructs you use to interface with others so long as the work is getting done.  

However, if you are Joe Shmoe developer and a client says "can you do XYZ", it's much better if you can say "yeah, our team can handle that" vs "I'll have to find a contractor to help me out with that."  Just make sure that you can make good on that promise ;)

## How To Appear Larger

So, now you know why you might want to appear larger. Below are some techniques that helped me "fake it till I made it".

#### 1. Register a company 

This is a critical first step. Most indies (in the US at least) will register as a sole proprietor. Right away this is a dead giveaway that you are limited in time, resources, and ability.  For more reasons than one, I'd suggest resgistering as an LLC or an S-Corp.

#### 2. Start referring to yourself in the context of your team

Instead of saying "Yeah, I could do that", start training yourself to say "Yeah, my team could do that." or "We have that capabitly".  Trust me, I wish I would have done this one day.  The transition from **I** to **we** gets more difficult as time goes on.

#### 3. Create a professional website

Hacker / Bio sites are super cool and all, but I'd suggest creating a full website for your shop. Originally, I used this site as my main entry point for clients.  Eventually, I wisened up and created [pixegon.com](http://pixegon.com) and began sending clients there. From the outside there is no telling how large or small our team is (other than the [about page](http://www.pixegon.com/about/) of course). But team photos are options ;)

Along these sames lines, as devs we love to "tinker".  I have probably changed my blog engine more times that I have written a blog post.  My suggestion is to pick something stupid simple such as a self hosted wordpress site or even easier, a Squarespace site.

Also, it doesn't hurt to spend a few $K on a graphic artist to help you out.  

#### 4. Create a "brand" for your company and use it on everything

Again, I thought it was super cool to send minimal invoices from Vim.  I felt super 1337 h4x.  But as big brands know, repetition is critical from recognition.  Since we have started our branding/marketing, our clients (and now our community) are really starting to recognize us when they see our logo around town.

We put our branding on everything including

- email signatures
- contracts
- proposals
- websites
- sometimes in apps we build (after discounting the app costs)

#### 5. Having a buisness phone line

Man, have I been burned by this one. I can't tell you how many times I have answered incoming business calls on my cell phone "hey bro!" thinking the number was someone else.

There are a few potential options

1. Have a separate phone. This is also known as the drug dealer route.  
2. Google voice number . I did this one for a long time. Still a bit of a pain to manage/differentiate from regular calls
3. Set up a phone tree.  We have done this at Pixegon, however I'm still on the fence as to whether or not this is cheasy.
4. Hire an answering service. This one is pretty cool, but def costs a bit of money.

## Some Final Thoughts

These are just a few things that have worked for me.  Make sure when implementing the above, you are ready.  If you don't have contractors in place with specific capabilities for example, don't advertise that you do.  This will only cause issues for you. Also, this isn't one size fits all. Sometimes I choose to appear as "Brandon the developer" to appeal to some of the clients mentioned in the first part of this post, while other times I try to puff the team up as much as possible (government contracts don't seem as keen on indies IMHO).

Hopefully you find some value in this post. If so, be sure to let me know on [twitter](http://twitter.com/brandontreb).
