title: Never Stop Selling - Lesson Learned By Losing a Large Client
---

We have all been there. You are coming up on the end of a project and realize starting the following day you will have **nothing** to do.  For many of us, this is a planned, much needed break, but for others this represents the start of a valley where we quickly become desparate for work.

Recently, my team experienced something like this on quite a large scale. A couple of years ago, when Pixegon was just starting out, we somehow landed a whale of a client.  This client started off small but quickly grew from 172 hours per month to over a thousand.  Before I knew it, we were billing hundreds of thousands of dollars each month.

During this time, I was able to hire on new developers, designers, and project managers to scale the ever-growing need of my whale-sized client.  

Naturally I got lazy. I figured it would always be like this.  This client was basically a software company and _we_ were their software team.  They needed us and we needed them.

We continued on like this for a little over 1.5 years until one day in July I got a phone call to halt all work immediatly. Dumbstruck, I wanted to know what happened.  Apparently, their technology team didn't communicate with their finanace department very well and they were quickly running out of money.

The obvious first thing to go was our team since we were probably their highest budget item. No notice, nothing.  They cashed out their last invoice and sent us on our way.

As I mentioned before, I hadn't been able to foresee this coming.  Here we are just about to enter the slowest time in the year for selling software projects, with close to a hundred thousand dollars a month in salaries and very few "other clients".

Of course, if I had been selling and filling our pipeline the entire time, this wouldn't have happend, however we had to rely on the bank account and previous profits to keep us afloat until we landed some more work.  This prompted us to enlist the entire team (devs, design, pm, etc...) as sales reps and start selling as much as possible to whoever would listen.

Ultimately, we ended up closing more contracts in Q4 than ever, however I have taken away a very valuable lesson from this situation.  That is, to always be selling.  In feast and in fammine. The worst that could happen is you could be oversold and have to schedule work out in the future.  It has taken me quite some time to understand this, but I'm glad I finally did.
