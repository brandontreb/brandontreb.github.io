title: Trying Something New

Every single year since the beginning of time (at least since the beginning of this blog), I have resolved to "blog more".  And every single year, I have absolutely failed at that.

So, in favor of [systems over resolutions](http://www.businessinsider.com/set-goals-not-resolutions-tim-ferriss-2016-12), I am attempting to do something different this year.  Over the holiday, I blogged 12 posts related to my experiences as an independent software developer as well as business owner that I feel could benefit the community.  These share everything from selling contracts to hiring friends, mistakes made, and more.

I plan on releasing one post a month on the first Monday of every month.  Given that I already have these posts written, it _should_ be a no-brainer to blog consistently. I also intend on writing in-between posts, but at this point that's probably wishful thinking. 

If you have any interest in this sort of thing (software development consulting), then be sure to add yourself to the [mailing list](http://brandontreb.us3.list-manage1.com/subscribe?u=66135759856eefe4f6dcec97c&id=ef6c358d78).  

Wishing you a successful and exciting 2017.

**Cheers!**
