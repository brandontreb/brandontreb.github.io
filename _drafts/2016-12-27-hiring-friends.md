title: How To Hire Your Friends
---

One of my greatest joys around working with my team is the fact that we are all friends.  In fact, most of us were friends before I ever started the company.  This makes every team meeting, every Slack conversation, and every stand up feel like I'm just hanging out with my buddies.

However there are always huge warnings/red flags/issues when working with people who are close to you.  What if their performace falls? What if they don't like working for you? What if they quit, your have to fire them, the wives get upset at eachother, etc...
