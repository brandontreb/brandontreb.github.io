Being in the tech World, I often receive an email like this:
<blockquote>Hey Brandon, I have a buddy of mine that wants to get into programming. Where should he/she start?</blockquote>
It's not hard to imagine why someone would want to enter the software development profession.  Writing code allows you to express your creativity in a way no other career can.  This career path is not only profitable, but extremely fulfilling from a creative standpoint.

Here are my top 5 tips to kicking off your career in software development:
<h4>Determine Your Goals And Interests</h4>
Most people kicking the tires of software development aren't aware that there are quite a few paths in this industry.  I would suggest you find the path that mosts excites you and aligns with your goals and passions.  Some example paths you might head down:
<ul>
    <li>Mobile: This is usually the answer I get as everyone wants to build the next Instagram.  If this is your chosen path, I'd suggest narrowing it down further between iOS Development and Android development.  For iOS, I absolutely recommend <a href="http://www.raywenderlich.com" target="_blank">Ray Wenderlich's tutorials</a> or <a href="https://www.bignerdranch.com/we-write/ios-programming/?gclid=CPnM2dz1rMoCFZJffgodJWUKpQ" target="_blank">Big Nerd Ranch's Book</a>. For Android, I recommend <a href="http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/android.html" target="_blank">Vogella</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Android-Programming-Ranch-Guide-Edition/dp/0134171454" target="_blank">Big Nerd Ranch</a>.</li>
    <li>Front-end web: Are you a designer interested in doing some programming.  Front-End web development is for you.  I would suggest you learn some of the modern Javascript frameworks such as <a href="https://angularjs.org" target="_blank">Angular</a>, <a href="http://backbonejs.org" target="_blank">Backbone</a>, <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/" target="_blank">React</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/showcases/front-end-javascript-frameworks" target="_blank">others</a>.</li>
    <li>Back-end web: This is also known as server-side development.  Most modern mobile and web applications are built on top of APIs.  Learning how to build these APIs is a great career path.  I would suggest learning a modern language like Ruby on Rails at <a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/book" target="_blank">https://www.railstutorial.org/book</a></li>
    <li>System programming.  If sitting in a cubicle working as a cog in some government contractor's system is your thing, I would suggest learning <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/overview/index.html" target="_blank">Enterprise Java</a>. Usually steady jobs, but boring IMHO.</li>
</ul>
Now that we have some of the different types of programming paths laid out, it's time to discuss the various company structure that interests you.  Here are a few potential types of companies you might want to work for.
<ul>
    <li>Startup - We hear the word startup all too often. They are synonymous with ping pong tables and fridges full of beer.  Startups are usually a good choice for anyone wanting to work on cutting edge technology focused on rapid growth. Startups tend to be a little more risky however given the fact that if they don't succeed in the first few years, they are usually scrapped (or sold).  They can also have some of the highest payouts (assuming you took equity and it didn't get diluted when/if the company sells).</li>
    <li>Consultancy - A consultancy is a software company that builds software for other companies.  Usually, working for these types of companies provides a lot of opportunity to learn and grow as you should be be able to glean experience from the more senior developers.  <a href="http://pixegon.com" target="_blank">I happen to run a consultancy</a>.</li>
    <li>Indie - Want to make money from your own software? This is the way to go.  Long hours, high risk, but high reward for those who are willing to put in the work.</li>
    <li>Independant Consultant - Ahh, working for yourself.  In this model, you find the clients, you build the software, and you do the maintenance.  This is one of my personal favorite ways to go.  <a href="http://brandontreb.com/becoming-a-software-consultant-my-backstory/" target="_blank">Here is how I ended up going that route</a>.</li>
    <li>Government Contractor - This is kind of like a consultancy, only you sell your soul and hate your job.</li>
    <li>Non-profit - You get paid in good juju.</li>
    <li>Big Tech Company - These are your Googles, Apples, Amazons, etc... If working for one of these company's is your end goal, I would usually say go to college first, get a CS degree and then pursue.  Unless you build something amazing, you will be hard pressed to land a job at one of these any other way.</li>
    <li>Non-tech company - Almost every company nowadays is hiring software developers.  Even non-software related companies can benefit from the help of a developer.  These types of positions usually pay less however they give you a lot of flexibility to grow and learn as they have no clue how to manage you :)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Learn, Build, Repeat</h4>
<blockquote>"Formal education will make you a living; self-education will make you a fortune." - Jim Rohn</blockquote>
Whatever your goals are, plan on spending an exorbitant amount of time on self-education. As you are learning, <strong>build things</strong> that are publicly available.  One of the most powerful resumes you can have in the software development industry is the ability to point to something useful on the web and say "I made that".

As you begin to build things and then learn some more, you will realize the things you built suck.  This is a natural part of the process.  You will look back at your old code and exclaim "What was I thinking!?".  This is great, it's a good sign you are moving forward.

Once you have built something you are proud of, put it up on github, submit it to the App Store, or just create a publicly available website.  Then, get feedback from people you trust.

Finally, after you are happy with it, start something else. I can't stress this enough, employers want to see projects that they can put their hands on.  This serves a much more important purpose than your resume and in some cases degree.
<h4>Community involvement</h4>
From day 1, you should begin interacting with the community.  I would suggest starting by finding a local meet up in your area. So, after you have determined your area of interest, Google things like "Austin Javascript developers meet up", or "Denver Cocoaheads meeting", etc... You will be surprised by how many people are most likely meeting in your area on a weekly basis to discuss this stuff you are interested in learning.

Developer meet ups are a great way to:
<ul>
    <li>Find other like-minded individuals that can point your in the right direction</li>
    <li>Find leads on local jobs. Usually, they have a mailing list and receive information about local jobs before as are posted elsewhere (in my experience)</li>
    <li>Find a mentor.  As with any new venture, it's often helpful to find someone who is willing to mentor you. Here is a great <a href="http://fourhourworkweek.com/tag/how-to-find-a-mentor/" target="_blank">Tim Ferris post</a> on finding one.</li>
    <li>As questions.  You will undoubtable get stuck on something.  Developer meet ups are a great place to share and ask for help</li>
    <li>Learn something new. Many developer meet ups have an educational aspect where developers take turns teaching the group on a specific topic.</li>
</ul>
For the reasons above, I feel that attending local developer meet ups is paramount to the early success in your programming career.
