With all of the buzz around the [iTether][1] App, I figured I&#8217;d offer a more permanent solution since Apple will surely yank this soon

Last year, a developer published his code for an http [SOCKS][2] proxy called iProxy. This will give your iPhone the ability to create a SOCKS server in which your laptop can connect to via the Bonjur protocol.

Once connect, all of your computer&#8217;s http traffic will be routed through the server on your iPhone essentially giving you **free tethering**. Since this isn&#8217;t using the iPhone&#8217;s built-in tethering method, I&#8217;d assume At&t could not detect it&#42;. After looking at the code, it becomes pretty obvious how the SOCKS proxy works and makes me kick myself that I didn&#8217;t write it (or find this code sooner).

The [setup][3] is a little complex, but you only need to do it once. I would love to hear in the comments if any of you has had some experience with this. I will also share my own as soon as I can get it installed later today.

Download the project over at [github][4].

Happy Coding!
