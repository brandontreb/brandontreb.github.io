The culture of Digg is generally very liberal (to say the least). That is why I was very surprised to find one of the top stories of the day entitled &#8221;[Was Jesus A Real Person?][1]&#8221;. Obviously, the comments section of the article was full of people arguing about the matter.

I found the article to be quite well written and made a stellar case for the existence of Jesus. So whether you are a believer or not, you should check it out. [Take a look for yourself ][2]and let me know what you think.
