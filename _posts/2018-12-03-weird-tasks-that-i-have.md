Many of you might not know this, but my family and I live in a [converted schoolbus](http://trebventure.com). 

Today, I had quite a few “bus chores” and I figured that I would share them here because together, they do seem a bit odd. 

- Change composting toilet 
- Fill up propane tanks
- Add heat tape to fresh water lines
- Replace RV vent in roof because it started leaking

Sometimes I wonder if I have _more_ chores on the bus than in a traditional home. 

Whatever, off to chop wood for my [tiny wood stove](http://www.instagram.com/trebventure/p/Bj47D7hn2U9/)...
