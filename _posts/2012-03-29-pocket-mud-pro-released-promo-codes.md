I am very proud to announce a brand new version of my [Pocket MUD Pro][1] application for iPhone. I have been working very hard to make a perfect MUD client that is suitable for hardcore mud players, visually impaired mud players, and casual mud players.

Here are some of the features:

  * Support for all orientations
  * Full ANSI color support
  * Dedicated prompt
  * Zoomable Text View
  * Perfect rendering of MUD text (check out the maps)
  * Very fast
  * Hides Telnet codes from the user (unlike every other MUD client)
  * Autoconnect on startup
  * List of MUDS
  * Favorite List
  * Unlimited Command history
  * Quickly cycle through command history
  * Triggers using the lua scripting language
  * Text Command Alias
  * Lua scripted aliases
  * Timer Support
  * Background support. Stay connected for up to 10 minutes after you close the application.
  * Support for multiple commands separated by semicolons
  * Comes packed with a list of some of the most popular muds
  * In-App Documentation of triggers and aliases
