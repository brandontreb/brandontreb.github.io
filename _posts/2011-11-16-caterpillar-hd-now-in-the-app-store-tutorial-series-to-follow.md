I have just released the update to my Centipede clone called [Caterpillar][1]. For those of you who don&#8217;t know, I am doing a 6 part series on how to create this game over at [MobileTuts+][2].

This update adds some interesting functionality on which I will be blogging about in the near future.

I have added iAds to my cocos2D project and when the iAds fail to serve (which is about 75% of the time), I replace them with Admob ads. This was achieved by creating a new Admob ad view inside of the `bannerView:didFailToReceiveAdWithError:` delegate method.

I will either post a full tutorial about doing this Here or on Mobile Tuts. Either way, I&#8217;ll keep you posted.

Also, be sure to [download the game][1], test it out, and lemme know if you have suggestions. Version 1.1 addressed quite a few issues from feedback (namely poor controls).

Happy coding!
