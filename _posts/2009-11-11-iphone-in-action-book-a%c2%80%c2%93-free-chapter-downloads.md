[Manning Publishing][1] has started their MEAP (Manning Early Access Program) for the book I am working on. What this means for you is FREE DOWNLOADS. There is currently only one chapter available, but there will be more as the book progresses.

The chapter currently available is about audio recording and playback. It goes into detail about the AVAudio frameworks as well as the MPMediaPlayer.

So be sure to [check it out][2] and feedback on the chapter is GREATLY appreciated.
