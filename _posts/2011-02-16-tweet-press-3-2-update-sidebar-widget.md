I have recently had an overwhelming number of requests for a sidebar widget that displays your recent Tweetpress photos. Well, it&#8217;s finally here! The update was actually quite trivial to make. If I had known how simple it would be, I would have made it months ago.

Make sure you update to the latest version: [tweetpress 3.2][1]

**How to use it**  
In the WordPress admin, click on Appearance and the Widgets from the sidebar menu. If your theme supports widgets (which is should), you will see a Tweetpress widget in the available widgets list.

Next drag that widget into the sidebar area and modify the settings.

You can configure the title of the widget as well as the number of photos to be displayed. Please comment here or shoot me an email if you experience any issues with it. I&#8217;m also open to suggestions.
