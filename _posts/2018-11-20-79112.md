Pretty cool, I just set my Jekyll blog up to receive Web Mentions via [webmention.io](https://webmention.io). Next step: Display m.b replies on the post themselves.  Amazing what you can do with a statically generated site.

OK, I need to stop farting around with this stuff and actually do _some_ work.
