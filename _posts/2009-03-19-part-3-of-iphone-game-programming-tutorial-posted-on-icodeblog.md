It&#8217;s been a while, but I finally posted part 3 of the[ iPhone Game Programming tutorial][1] series on iCodeblog.com. The focus of this tutorial was to create a splash page for your game that fades into your game&#8217;s main view.

I chose to create this tutorial after seeing many games that just jump right in to the main game play. A splash page makes the game feel more &#8220;professional&#8221; as well as gives the developer a chance to brand the app by displaying a company logo or something to that extent.

Hopefully, I will be able to get part 4 up in a timely fashion to teach developers how to incorporate sounds into their games.

So, go ahead and check out part 3 of the [iPhone Game Programming Tutorial Series][1].
