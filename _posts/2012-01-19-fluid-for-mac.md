As of OSX Lion, I have started to seriously loathe some of the build-it Mac apps (such as Mail, and iCal). While I previously had no issues with them, they now seem to be very clunky and crash quite often. Being a developer, I thought &#8220;why don&#8217;t I write an app that wraps web apps for you so you basically get &#8220;native web apps&#8221; that have icons and are launchable?&#8221;.

After a quick Google search, I realized **[this already exists!][1]**. The app is called Fluid and it does an incredible job of what I described above and more.

Here are the feature highlights.

  * Create a &#8220;native&#8221; Mac app for any web app
  * Custom icon for each &#8220;native&#8221; app you create
  * Full screen mode
  * User scripps. These are my favorite. They allow you to update the badge count based on information in the browser. See below for a sample user script.

**Sample User Script For Twitter**

<div>
  <pre>&lt;code class=’javascript’>(function () {
        if (window.fluid) {
            setInterval(function updateBadge() {
                var counts = /\d+/.exec(document.title);
                if (counts && counts[0] &gt; 0) {
                    window.fluid.dockBadge = counts[0] &gt; 99 ? ‘99+’ : counts[0];
                } else {
                    window.fluid.dockBadge = ”;
                }
            }, 2000);
        }
    })();&lt;/code></pre>
</div>

Fluid is free with some minimal features, but I urge you to drop the $4.99 to gain full screen mode and user scripts. It&#8217;s well worth it. I am not affiliated with them in any way, just a happy customer.
