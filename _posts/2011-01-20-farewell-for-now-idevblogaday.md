Hey guys,

I wanted to thank everyone for letting me be a part of the iDevBlogADay community. You guys have been super supportive and I really appreciate all of the commenting, retweeting, and upvoting of my iDevBlogADay articles.

I have found myself in a position with life (work + family) where I may no longer be able to consistently write a post per week. So, after 2 months of writing, it is time for me to pass the torch to the next blogger on the list.

I will still continue to blog (and continue my Twitter For Mac Series), so I really encourage you to subscribe to my [RSS feed][1] (or [Twitter feed][2]).

Thanks again and Happy Coding!
