While mashing the keyboard (as I often do when debuggin poorly written outsourced code), I stumbled upon a very useful OSX hotkey.

## âŒ˜-option-d

This command will cause the Dock to go in and out of auto-hide mode.

Not the most useful, but very helpful to geeks like me who rearrange their desktop every day.
