I was just reading this article posted on CNET news [Apple&#8217;s tablet: It&#8217;s all about developers][1] and thought to myself, it&#8217;s a great day to be a software developer. This quote from the article got me exceptionally excited.

> &#8220;Never have developers mattered more. As Apple readies its tablet announcement party for later Wednesday morning, the big question remaining is whether developers will join, or whether they&#8217;ll join <a class="zem_slink" title="Android" rel="homepage" href="http://code.google.com/android/">Google&#8217;s Android</a> and Chrome initiatives.&#8221;

With the release of all of these new devices, developers have just gotten much more marketable. It&#8217;s amazing how our worth skyrockets with every new Apple, Google, or Microsoft event. Never before have software developers had so many opportunities to be successful.

There are now over 100K applications in the <a class="zem_slink" title="App Store" rel="homepage" href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/appstore/">iTunes App Store</a> with over half of them being paid. That means, Apple is making money for upwards of 50,000 software developers!

I for one, love being a software developer and am very excited for what the future holds for us.
