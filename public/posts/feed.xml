      <description>I actually enjoy when my browser crashes hard and forgets all of my open tabs that I‘ve been hoarding for weeks
I was never going to read that article or mess around with that code tool anyway
There’s got to be a lesson about living in the moment or something somewhere in there</description>

      <description>I’ve spent months working on a blogging engine. I have always wanted to create my own ever since typing rails new blog in 2006.
I finally did it, and I realized I would still be better off using Hugo.
Oh well, lesson learned. At least I was finally able to scratch the itch.</description>

      <description>I’ve been taking my oldest boy (14) to the gym lately. It’s been an absolute joy! He usually fights me on going, but by the end, he’s glad he went. It’s been a great time of bonding and sharing something that I’m passionate about with him. 💪</description>

      <description>Since seeing a bobcat in The Bosque a few months ago, I now am constantly looking over my shoulder while I’m out there on my runs.

      <description>I feel like this applies to all “Sign in With” services (except indieauth of course ;)). I love the move to try and kill the password, however the state of these services is insane. I’m 1Pass for almost everything these days.</description>

      <description>My son’s friends discovered my blog and were talking about it to him (must have googled his last name).
Long story short, I’m pretty famous now.</description>

      <description>I have been super inspired by all of the posts this month about everyone&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;year in books&amp;rdquo;. I thought I was a pretty avid reading, but it turns out, I have a long way to go.
I had a pretty good mix of actually reading vs. listening to books last year. For the record, I&amp;rsquo;m a die hard Amazon Kindle fan (I know, not the best for authors, etc&amp;hellip; but I just love the form fit.</description>

      <description>I recently wrote a post about using AI to filter social feeds.
It appears that the original founders of Instagram have a new startup that&amp;rsquo;s doing just that
I signed up for the beta and can’t wait to see what they come out with!</description>

      <description>It’s not people’s job to show you what’s interesting or great about themselves. It’s your job to find it. This is life, not a sales convention. @iammarkmanson
Be genuinely curious about other people. Everyone is dying to share their stories, they just need a little coaxing.</description>

      <description>For this month&amp;rsquo;s retro game, I started playing The Legend of Zelda: Link&amp;rsquo;s Awakening DX on my RG351V.
I absolutely LOVE this game and it looks gorgeous on this device.
I&amp;rsquo;ve played through most of Links Awakening on the original Gameboy hardware, however I never completed it due to the battery dying.
I&amp;rsquo;m excited to finally play it all the way through!</description>

Chronophoto - The Photographical History Game
Who knew guessing the year a photo was taken could be so fun. As a comment on HN points out , this could be really cool as a daily challenge (a la Wordle) where everyone gets the same photos and competes.</description>

      <description>Anyone who had participated in crypto for a significant amount of time, has a story or two about missed opportunity or even loss. This is my story.
In 2016, a client of mine asked me to build them a DApp (distributed app) on the Ethereum blockchain. At that time, ETH was trading around $100 USD per coin.
The client, being super into crypto, offered to pay me in Ethereum only.</description>

      <description>Reflections on the impact of the &amp;lsquo;4-Hour Workweek&amp;rsquo; 15 years later
They had never read it. If they did, they would have found that it is a philosophical wake-up call disguised as a bunch of life hacks. The whole book is basically him channeling the energy of poet Mary Oliver and yelling, “Don’t waste your wild and precious life!”
When I read The 4 Hour Workweek in 2010, it had a profound impact on my life and trajectory.</description>

      <description>No, Blogging Is Not Dying Anytime Soon - Darius Foroux
But still, people who read have always been in the minority. And I think that’s what most people who think that “video is the future” don’t get. Sure, people are getting lazier and they want you to feed them content.
But think about it. Do you really want to serve those types of people?!
I love “Blogging Is Not Dead” posts because I love to blog and often wonder if it’s a waste of time.</description>

      <description>While I was still using Twitter, I set up a ton of keyword filters. This was especially true during the election seasons. I prefer using social media to connect with people and find communities surrounding my hobbies and interests.
While these filters did an ok job, they often times had false positives and filtered out content that I was actually interested in. An example of this might be a filter on the word Trump.</description>

      <description>There are so many beautiful moments every single day that I get to share with my kids.
I was reminded of this today as I looked in my rear view mirror and watched my daughter sing along to her favorite Taylor Swift song.
Feeling very grateful today that I get to be a dad.</description>

It’s always full of so much positivity and interesting people.</description>

      <description>With the rise of ChatGPT and other AI text interfaces, there emerges a new issue called Prompt Leakage. For these systems to work well, a carefully crafted prompt must be entered in order to give the AI very specific directions.
A prompt might be something as simple as &amp;ldquo;How many calories are in an apple?&amp;rdquo;, or it might be something much more complex (see below).
Lately, many startups have capitalized on these AI text systems and the &amp;ldquo;wizard behind the curtain&amp;rdquo; appears to be a super secret prompt.</description>

      <description>So, it looks like @paul@tapbots.social has confirmed that Twitter is shutting down API keys for 3rd party apps.
In addition to this change, they have completely removed the ability to sort the timeline chronologically. That was the only feature that made Twitter somewhat usable.
In light of these changes, I have finally begun the process of downloading my archived Twitter data and moving off for good.</description>

      <description>Over the years, I have tried many Aeropress methods for making coffee. After many variations, I have found this one to be the best and most consistent.
Recipe Method: inverted Beans: 30g (usually Ethiopian) Grind: course Water: 200g Time: 60s Instructions Start heating the water in a kettle. While the water is heating, grind 30g of coffee in the grinder and pour it into the inverted Aeropress.
Place the Aeropress on the scale, pour in 100g of water, and stir.</description>

      <description>Snowboarding was a bust today.
We drove all the way up the Santa Fe Ski Area (1.5 hours from my house) only to turn around and head home.
The line to rent was over an hour long and the lift lines were nuts! I have never seen it that busy.
We’ll try again next week…</description>

      <description>@manton I have a few questions/notes about non microblog hosted sites (mine now supports webmention and microformats) and m.b integration.
When I reply from my domain,it doesn’t link to my user on m.b. Even though my domain is associated with it. It creates a new m.b. user named brandontreb.com instead of showing it from my @brandontreb account. When replying, should I sent a webmention to m.b. Or the users custom domain?</description>

      <description>In the spirit of Christmas, my garage door decided to “Home Alone” me. When I opened it, something on a top shelf caught the door bringing down the entire shelf.
Cans of wood stain then came plummeting down and burst all over the garage floor and cars.
Super fun clean up.🎄</description>

      <description>I love it! I remember playing Starcraft using NetZero. We had to run a patch otherwise there was a hideous banner that was plastered along the top :)
BTW, your blog has been a huge source of inspiration. I have spent the last 6 months building an indie web-centric single-user blog engine (my site is currently running it). Your tools (Im currently posting on Quill) and documentation have been absolutely invaluable!</description>

      <description>My router decided to die a couple days ago. Needless to say, our &amp;ldquo;Smart Home&amp;rdquo; became pretty dumb without a solid internet connection. I just got the Eero system setup and am very happy with it so far.</description>

      <description>My good friends Denver and Ray recently opened a cigar shop called Padres.
The name is super clever as they both are/were pastors of local churches.
It’s such a good way to get together with friends, hang out and have great discussions.</description>

      <description>As it gets colder outside, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to do cold plunges.
Today it was 32f outside and my cold tub is 47f. So, technically, I’m getting into a hot tub?

      <description>This Episode of the Joe Rogan Podcast with Erika Thomson is awesome!
She talks all about bees 🐝 and beekeeping. It’s fascinating to learn how complex and amazing bee colonies are.
Definitely makes me want to add beekeeping to my ever growing list of hobbies!</description>

      <description>I have recently been experimenting with [Morning Pages](The Artist&#39;s Way Morning Pages Journal: A Companion Volume to the Artist&#39;s Way https://a.co/d/aB5Fi7e) on the recommendation of Tim Ferris.
I’m not sure that I can stick with it as strongly encourages hand-written pages. My hands cramp up so quickly and I write so small, the journaling takes almost an hour to complete.
Does anyone have any suggestions on a journaling technique that has worked for you (digital or physical)?</description>

What an incredible experience bringing my oldest son to this concert. Weird Al truly does span the generations.

      <description>A few months back, I purchased an Anbernic RG351v handheld emulator.
I couldn’t be happier with it. It has been an absolute joy to play the games from my childhood.
There are so many NES and SNES games that I started, but could never complete when I was a kid. This little device is a joy to revisit them on.
Starting last month, I convinced my buddy Will to buy one as well and we started a monthly retro gaming club.</description>

      <description>I’m designing a new software development paradigm.
It’s called VDD (Vibe driven development)
It’s when the team no longer follows any best practices, so the only way I can help them is just to send “positive vibes”.</description>

He was an incredible man who loved my wife, my kids, and me dearly.</description>

      <description>I just saw a message today that Github is going to start charging for Co Pilot. While this bums me out, it definitely saves me more than $10/month in time.
Cp Pilot has become an integral part of my workflow and saves me hours of Stack Overflow research as well as time spent copying and pasting of boilerplate code.</description>

      <description>Every day that we lived in the bus was experimental. We had new adventures, new ideas, as well as lots of troubleshooting. I often miss those days, but am really grateful for the home we have built. Living in 320 square ft for 3 years for a family got pretty tight.</description>

Note: I was on the site because I saw someone with the URL on their truck with a sign that says “NASA is a hoax”.

      <description>I LOVE the idea of taking modern web apps to the Terminal. As a heavy user of ssh, tmux, screen, etc&amp;hellip; the idea of seldom leaving the terminal seems very romantic.
There was a recent Show HN Post about a small app called lists.sh that really caught my attention.
The first very interesting aspect of this technology is it uses Public Key Cryptography to establish user accounts. No emails, no passwords, high security.</description>

      <description>I have never seen micro.blog so active. It must be because of The Great Twitter Exodus. I understand the hate for Musk, however I don&#39;t understand how him buying the company makes it any worse.

      <description>I have to set a bimonthly calendar reminder to change my kid’s screen time passcode.
At roughly 4 guesses per day (without getting locked out) * 3 devices, they usually guess it without detection.

      <description>Apple says they&#39;re removing my game because it&#39;s more than 2 years old
This HN thread really resonated with me. I have been building and publishing iOS apps since the dawn of the App Store in 2008. In those 14 years, I have shipped over 200 apps, and do you want to know how many are still in the App Store? Zero.
Some of these takedowns are due to startups failing or clients deciding to go in another direction, but still quite a few are forced out due to Apple’s update policy.</description>

      <description>The thermostat at the air bnb we are staying at had a locked out smart thermostat set to a really uncomfortable temp. Fortunately, you can’t change the default pass on this model and it was easy to compute. (1234+date code in settings). Now, it’s a nice 69° F in my house.</description>

      <description>My 12yo love/hates my dad jokes these days. Tonight I told him that was going to start a Blink 182 cover band called “Wink 91” and we’ll only play half of their songs.
Needless to say, I was met with an eye roll.</description>

      <description>I’m rediscovering learning to play guitar after years away from it. Though, I had 10+ years of experience, I’m approaching it with a “beginner’s mindset” this time and (re) learning the basics.
It’s so much more fun this time around.</description>

      <description>Fall in New Mexico is my absolute favorite. Every year, I’m always astonished by how beautiful the weather and foliage are.
Today was no exception. I’m very grateful to live here and get to experience this beauty.

      <description>I’ve always loved the phrase:
&amp;gt; “Chop your own wood and it will warm you twice”
From a figurative stance about hard work, but also literally. When I want a fire outside, I begin splitting wood. By the time I’m done, I’m always way too warm to want to actually light it.</description>

      <description>&amp;gt; “Not wanting something is just as good as having it.”
I heard this quote on the Tim Ferris Podcast by @naval. I’ve always identified with #minimalism and this quote really sums it up.</description>

      <description>Some young punks overheard me talking about JavaScript at lunch today. They felt it necessary to come to my table and tell me “typescript is waybetter”. They don’t realize that this sort of thing screams “I’m a junior developer! I know very little about the tech industry!”
If you are a newer developer, learn early that you are greatly limiting your potential by marrying a subset of programming languages. You will greatly increase your value by being open to learning and building in any language that is best suited for the project.</description>

      <description>I&#39;m deep in Kotlin dev now and I find it to be much like Android itself. It&#39;s very functional, but lacks overall polish and sexiness. It often provides functionality that I didn&#39;t ask for, yet makes it extremely difficult to perform tasks that would be otherwise trivial in iOS.</description>

      <description>When I first started consulting, I had everything tied to my name. My company name was Treb Studios, my email was brandon@brandontreb.com, and my whole business was tied to me.
This was fine for a while&amp;hellip;until I started growing. I hired contractors with the intention of replacing myself on my existing projects. This proved to be very challenging.
Clients didn’t want other developers, they wanted Brandon, because that’s what they were promised.</description>

      <description>Tonight, I&#39;m going to a party for local entrepreneurs.
I was getting ready for the party and thinking about the signals I am sending with every detail I put into my appearance. How do I want to be perceived? Should I go combover or faux-hawk, slacks or jeans, watch or Fitbit, leather or suit jacket? All of these decisions don&#39;t necessarily paint the picture of Brandon, so much as they paint the picture of who Brandon wants you to believe he is.</description>

      <description>I have really been enjoying listening to Darknet Diaries lately. It’s a Podcast about hacks and software security vulnerabilities.
The show really makes me realize how crappy and insecure most software is. Most importantly, it has gotten me much more security-minded in the software that I build.
If you aren’t already listening to it, I’d suggest you check it out. You will soon put on your tin foil hat like me and start to believe everybody is trying to hack you.</description>

      <description>My wife and I are hard core “type-a” people. I mean, so planned that we send each other calendar invites for date night (don’t judge what we consider romantic ;)).
I didn’t used to be like this. When I was younger and in college, I was a total scatter brain, a C student by choice.
This all changed the day I was laid off and had to start my own company.</description>

      <description>I absolutely hate scoping projects. It&#39;s such uninteresting / uninspiring work.
It&#39;s ironic because scoping generally translates to work/dollars, so it&#39;s a critical part of my business.
Also, I can&#39;t outsource this task. I don&#39;t trust anyone to do it correctly and accurately</description>

      <description>Many of you might not know this, but my family and I live in a converted schoolbus.
Today, I had quite a few “bus chores” and I figured that I would share them here because together, they do seem a bit odd.
Change composting toilet Fill up propane tanks Add heat tape to fresh water lines Replace RV vent in roof because it started leaking Sometimes I wonder if I have more chores on the bus than in a traditional home.</description>

      <description>The other day, I was having a conversation over Slack with my development team. They were working on a client project (and doing a killer job), and there was a particular UX pattern that seemed very unintuitive to me. This app was designed by the client, so there was little the dev team could do beyond making suggestions, so they went ahead and implemented it per the spec.
After fiddling around with it for a few minutes, I literally couldn&#39;t understand how to complete the particular task and had to ask the team lead for some help.</description>

      <description>How to Retire Forever on a Fixed Chunk of Money - Mr. Money Mustache
Another solid post from mmm. His blog was one of the first I read that set us on the path of financial freedom and minimalism.
If you don’t already know about him, I’d suggest starting at the beginning and reading through all of his posts.
I promise it will be worth it.</description>

      <description>My little brother was recently in town for the holidays. He’s about to graduate from college with a CS degree, so naturally we talked about searching for a job.
I figured I would share the advice I gave to him here in hopes that it might help others.
Don’t be discouraged when you get turned down. Having hired many employees over the years, I have learned that there are so many reasons to not hire a candidate.</description>

      <description>As developers, we spend so much time perfecting our craft. We are always on the hunt for hacks, tips, and tweaks.
We always set out to write the most clever and reusable code possible. This is all great&amp;hellip;until it’s time to ship.
I have seen it time after time. Developers over-optimizing their code, writing protocol after protocol. All the while, they slip further and further behind schedule.
When the client asks the dev about the delay on feature X, the dev proceeds to explain the super cool reusable, component-driven,state managed, highly available, future proof, buzzword, buzzword system they are creating.</description>

      <description>In our house, we often joke that “the diet starts Monday”. Usually, this is in response to some conclusion that we are not currently on the healthiest path.
Procrastination is in our DNA. We put everything off until the absolute last minute. For me, it’s usually side projects. Projects that I know will make some revenue to supplement some of my consulting income. It’s my goal to eventually move on from consulting, however that has been on my “resolution list” for years, with little progress.</description>

      <description>It’s often much easier to have a sense of gratitude when things are going well. As humans, we are prone to focusing on the one bad thing that’s going wrong rather than the multitude of good things going right. This traces way back to a time where we needed this sense to stay away from danger.
My father-in-law was just admitted to the hospital with lukeumia. Although this is one of the harder times in our family’s lives, it’s really been a sobering experience giving me a stronger sense of gratitude for my wife and kids.</description>

      <description>“Just hack a quick proof of concept, we’ll rebuild it when we get more funding.” These are some words I often hear from clients who have minimal budgets.
They generally want my team to build something small/quick/cheap to get their concept across in hopes of securing more funds down the road.
What I have learned by saying “yes” to these types of requests in the past is, those quickly hacked prototypes often end up in production.</description>

      <description>I always receive cold emails. Some of them are personalized, and some of them are robotic. Sometimes, I’ll ignore and sometimes I’ll respond with something snarky (this is my spiritual gift). I get it. These are just part of the internet.
Whenever I get a cold email from someone local, it’s a different story. I always feel sorry for them. They have totally missed an opportunity to connect with someone in real life and possibly a sale.</description>

While I have seen many improvements in my communication (written and verbal), I believe the best benefit is around the community.
When I started blogging in 2008, my posts used to have upwards of 100 comments. Granted I was a renegade blogging about iOS in a time of Apple&#39;s dreaded NDA. I absolutely loved the feedback and the community that was forming around my writing.</description>

Anyway, the episode was hosted by a guy named A.J. Jacobs. Jacobs wrote a book on gratitude and is known for traveling the world to thank over 1,000 people involved in his morning coffee (think farmer, roaster, truck driver, etc&amp;hellip;).</description>

“This one will be different”, I murmur to myself. “I will keep it clean, organized, and free from hacks. “, I cheerfully gloat.
Why is it that it’s so hard to follow through on this philosophy? I said it yesterday, coding is hard.</description>

      <description>I have been building software for clients for over a decade now and have come to one solid conclusion: deliveries suck.
Maybe I&#39;m just the worst developer in the world and have worked with the worst teams and have had the worst clients… but I doubt it.
I have delivered early, on time, late, with more functionality, exactly the same, and in some cases less functionality (usually due to lack of funding) and still…rough deliveries.</description>

His response was obviously “Why would you just give away your ideas?”. I then proceeded to give him the &amp;quot;Your Ideas Are Worthless Without Proper Execution” spiel.
So, to put my money where my mouth is, I will be sharing my business ideas here; putting them out there in hopes that either a.</description>

      <description>When I was in high school, I used to think computers were for nerds. I was a skater obsessed with chasing girls with no time for computers.
It wasn’t until a buddy of mine convinced me to take a Visual Basic 6 class with him, that I realized that I was one of those “nerds”.
Quickly, I fell in love. The first “app” that I ever completed was a game that raced various animal sprites found online using a random number generator.</description>

      <description>Rates are a weird thing and chances are, yours are too low.
I spent years stressing about rates. I would always start strong and but then eventually get talked down (usually by myself).
I think rates go hand in hand with impostor sybdrom. “Why would anyone pay me that much”. It took me quite some time to over come this, however after many years, and multiple rate hikes, we are doing more business than ever.</description>

      <description>People often tell me things like &amp;quot;it must be nice to work for yourself”, or “I&#39;m working hard to make someone else rich&amp;quot;.
Having spent many years working for a company prior to starting my own, I can honestly say I would never want a boss again. However, I that doesn&#39;t stop me from frequently daydreaming about just how nice that would be.
The idea that having someone tell you what to do, give you a set schedule, allow you to clock out at the end of the day all sound so liberating.</description>

      <description>A few years back, when the company was growing particularly quickly, I made a decision to hire my friends. Although, I had been warned by many others that this was a bad idea, I was sure that I was going to do things differently.
I was going to have a management layer over my closest friends and then they could have the uncomfortable conversations should they arise.
Needless to say, this strategy worked for a time, however at some point, things got tough and I had to make some serious decisions.</description>

      <description>If you are a mobile developer in 2018, and are not consulting (at least on the side), you are missing out on a huge stream of revenue.
In the early days of mobile app development (2008/2009), it was fairly easy for an iOS or Android developer to get a gig with large companies (Food Network, ESPN, huge list of other names…). At that time, mobile was so new, that none of these companies had internal resources to support this budding vertical.</description>

      <description>I have been obsessed with Seth Godin lately. I&#39;ve been reading his books, listening to his podcasts, and devouring his blog posts.
It&#39;s amazing how he can just pump out wisdom day after day and speak so articulately on just about any subject. Some of his posts are incredibly insightful while others might seem like a small thought that just popped into his head. He doesn&#39;t seem to differentiate the two and that&#39;s incredible.</description>

      <description>Seth Godin recently discussed in an episode of the Tim Ferris Show a fear many of us have of the future. He used the example of him landing speaking gigs in which he was more apt to compromise and take gigs he didn’t particularly want on months in which no gigs were currently booked.
As someone in the consulting space, I can absolutely identify with this. In the past, I have taken clients in knowing very well that they will mostly be problematic (funding, difficult, or otherwise).</description>

      <description>I just had a realization that I’m a professional dream crusher. Being in software consulting, I hear multiple pitches every single week for all sorts of different software. While it’s not necessarily my job to tell people what’s good and bad, I feel it’s my responsibility to at least give them all of the information I can.
In my many years of doing this, I have learned a bit about what works and what doesn’t and I have gotten pretty good at saying no to projects that I don’t believe in.</description>

      <description>If I never have to touch Slack or Telegram again, it will be too soon. I have nothing against them as technologies, however the way teams and clients use them is a toxic waste of time and resources. Maybe I’m old school, but I think email and phone are way more effective.</description>

Since then, I love (re)discovering the language every chance I get.
I found this post incredibly well done with some great examples. I wish we had resources like this &amp;quot;back in my day”.

      <description>Over the past few months, I have had the pleasure of working on a DApp called thisorthat.io built on the Ethereum network. It has been an absolute blast. I have had so much fun building the smart contracts as well as the React front-end interface.
I truly believe there is a huge future here, and it can be especially lucrative for developers/startup teams. If you look at Dapp Radar, you can see that many of the top DApps have less than 1,000 DAU (daily active users).</description>

      <description>I’d say that my least favorite part about software development consulting is writing proposals.
Though they are critical to my sales process, etc… I always feel like they are such a drag and it literally takes me all day to write a proposal that should take 1 hour.
Anyone else?</description>

      <description>We got a pretty cool feature the other day on Daily Mail:
New Mexico couple sell their home to travel America in a $33,000 converted school bus with their three children
These things are usually pretty cool except they always mis quote us and “tweak” the details.</description>

      <description>tl;dr: micro.blog is pretty cool.
I have recently been thinking about my process of blogging / tweeting / facebooking / etc.. and have realized that I&amp;rsquo;m burnt out on all three. I LOVE to write. I started one of the first successful iOS Blogs, published numerous (software development books)[http://manning.com/trebitowski], and have been blogging since 2008. Here are a bit of thoughts about the various platforms and ultimately my solution.

      <description>In 2008, I was still in college. I had just landed my first job with a small consultancy as their first iOS developer replacing their outsourced Ukrainian team. Within my first week on the job, the CEO asked me to jump on a sales call as the technical lead. This absolutely terrified me. I remember doing things like ensuring that I had a full glass of water so my throat wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get so dry (it still did).</description>

      <description>As developers, we hear the echo chamber on Hacker News and others shouting at us to raise our rates. We are worth it. In theory they are right, we are worth it and we should be charging an industry standard rate. However, there are some instances when it&amp;rsquo;s OK to lower your rates.
Here are 3 times when you should consider lowering your rates:

      <description>Over at Pixegon, I really try to encourage my developers to have their own side projects. Often times, employers look at side projects as competition and try to own the works that their developers produce. Some will even go as far as to include this in their employee handbooks.
In my opinion, this stifles creativity and creates a feeling of contention between the employee and company.
People start side projects all of the time for a variety of reasons:</description>

It was something to the effect of &amp;ldquo;The internet levels the playing field, so someone without a job is without excuse&amp;rdquo;. Not shortly after I hit &amp;ldquo;Tweet&amp;rdquo;, did I receive an array of Tweets back from people I highly respected. I was immediately humbled, and it was pointed out to me that I had a severe lack of empathy.</description>

Joe asked me out for beers to discuss a new opportunity for a mobile project.</description>

      <description>Want to jump ship and be a software development consultant? This post will detail why this path is a much more fulfilling and safer path than a traditional job.
After interviewing quite a few developers in the consulting space, I quickly realized that this is a very common story. If you work for a company, they can usually let you go at any time for any reason. Given that this is your sole source of income, you are now in an extremely risky situation.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s late, you have been hacking all night to get the client a build. Finally, around 2:30 am, you hit submit and publish something to the client and go to bed. When you wake up in the morning, the first thing you see in your inbox is an email titled &amp;ldquo;Completely Broken!!1!&amp;rdquo;.
How could this be? You stayed up late, you hacked, you tested and you sweat over this build to find that it crashes for the client when they try to do something obvious.</description>

      <description>There is a familiar phrase that I hear all too often when a client comes to me with an existing application. It goes something like this:
“Our team spent quite a bit of money on our application and we don’t want to ship it. We are not proud of the product.”
It blows my mind that many developers and development teams are still in business given the poor quality of products that I see getting churned out all of the time.</description>

      <description>During my years of mobile development, I have heard the phrase “I have an idea for an app!” hundreds, if not thousands of times. Sometimes it would be from family members, sometimes my dentist during a cleaning, and sometimes from a naked dude standing in the sauna at the gym. Everyone pitches app ideas to me.
What I have learned from hearing so many pitches is this: apps really fall into one of three (sometimes four) categories.</description>

      <description>It cannot be overstated that writing down one’s goals is critical to acheiving them. Pair that with sharing them with others who might help keep you accountable and your probabilty of achieving those goals goes way up.
With this in mind, I have decided to share my 2015 goals here on my blog in hopes that I will do a better job of acheiving them in the new year. I tried to focus on more measurable goals rather than things like “eat better” and “exercise more”.</description>

      <description>One of the most common questions I get from software consultants is whether or not to accept fixed bid contracts. In this post, I’m hoping to shed some light on fixed bid vs. time and materials contracts and help you make the best decision for the project at hand.
Let’s start with some definitions to help you better understand what I am talking about.
A fixed bid contract is a contract where the developer and the client agree on a price and/or timeline up front for a particular contract.</description>

Working for a consultancy in my previous work-life I had seen contracts before, however, I never really paid enough attention to them to know what type of content went into them.
After quite a bit of research, I found an invaluable resource.</description>

“Hey Brandon, I have a killer project idea. Do you want to work on it? Please sign the NDA so we can talk.”
Early on when I first started consulting, I would have responded with something like “Sure send it over!” and signed the thing without hesitation. As of late, I have changed my view on NDAs; at least in this type of situation.</description>

Needless to say, I have grown and learned quite a bit over the past year and I wanted to share some of those experiences.
Income While I won’t share exact numbers, I left my 6 figure/year job to pursue the indie/consulting life.</description>

      <description>One thing I am often asked is “Where can I find good developers/contractors/subcontractors?” While I have found talent many different ways, I wanted to share my top 5 with you.
This post should be useful to you if you have a project and are looking to find a developer OR are a developer looking to subcontract some of your work. I am sharing these based solely on my experiences with them and hope you find value in this list.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the second part of my tutorial series “Creating An Image Gallery Like Over”. In this part of the tutorial, you will learn how to actually display the photos in the UICollectionView as well as give the user the ability to take photos with their camera.
If you haven’t already done so, please go back and complete part 1.
1. Custom UICollectionViewCell Start by creating a new subclass of UICollectionViewCell and naming it **PhotoCell.</description>

      <description>Recently, I have had to build an app (download link) that required the user to choose a photo from their photo library. Rather than just throwing up a UIImagePickerController like many apps, I decided to add a little bit of style. Being inspired by Over’s ultra simplistic (and beautiful) photo selection interface, I decided to fancy things up a bit.
For this tutorial, I will start with a Fresh iOS6 View-Based application that uses Storyboards and ARC.</description>

      <description>I wrote my very first blog post back in July of 2008 when I start iCodeBlog.com. I started the blog because I saw a huge need for iOS development tutorials on the web and really wanted to help others as I progressed in my development.
Well, quite a bit has changed since then. I have written books, spoken at conferences, and built and shipped over 40 iOS applications. Since selling iCodeblog in 2009, I have really let my passion for blogging fizzle.</description>

      <description>Welcome Hacker News! There’s some discussion happening in the comments; but, as always, the better conversation is on the article page on Hacker News itself.
Since going Indie, I am constantly asked about what software tools I use to facilitate the process. People are always curious about invoicing, time tracking, ticket management, etc…
The purpose of this post is two fold. First, I want to educate others on some of the cool tools I have found that have helped me out tremndously.</description>

      <description>tl;dr Present yourself to potential clients as if you have already made it. Don’t be scared, the work it out there. Freelancing FTW!1!
In the first week of December, I got a rather unfortunate (and unexpected) call from the CEO of the company I was working for. The gist of it was “we are reorganizing, and have decided to cut your position. Effective Immediately”. At this point, I was the Director Of Mobile Engineering and was making a very decent salary.</description>

      <description>As I mature as a developer, I try to rely on other people’s code more an more. Why build something from scratch when a solution already exists that you can fit in your project. In Pocket MUD Pro, I used 13 3rd party libraries and am using quite a bit more in the project that I’m currently working on. I figured that I would share some of the libraries that I have been using so that it might save you some time in the future.</description>

Well, people are listening and as of this posting, there are currently 15 Show HN posts in the top 30.</description>

      <description>I have just updated my MUD client [Pocket MUD Pro] to be a universal library. It was surprisingly easy to add the iPad support as most of the application was comprised of UITableViews.
The main “MUD” view was the most challenging part as it contains a couple UIWebViews, UIButons, and a UITextField. However, I chose to do something I feel is pretty cool.
Scripting The UI With Lua If I haven’t said it enough, I love lua.</description>

      <description>We believe that developers should have the freedom to price their games how they like, without interference from the online stores that sell the games. Why? Because it allows us to promote our games more freely, as we are doing here! We rely on the ability to promote our games for our livelihood and control over pricing is an important tool for this purpose.
Because We May is doing something very incredible here.</description>

MetaWatch has been around for quite some time now and looks *ok *, however their latest update appears to be completely in response to Allerta’s announcement/success of Pebble.</description>

      <description>A while back, my buddy seantron showed me some of his 3D games he’d been working on including this one. My initial reaction was “how the heck did he get the chopps to do that?”. While, Sean is an incredible developer with a ton of creativity, doing things like loading models, texture mapping, or even basic 3D projects are flippin hard.
A while back I tried my hand at 3D and made sort of a basic Minecraft style game from scratch using OpenGL ES.</description>

It wasn’t until a coworker of mine sat down and really showed me just how cool/simple/powerful Vim can be. Just using Vim is a new adventure every day and has really improved my productivity. I now use it to code, blog, and even jot down quick notes.
Last week, I saw on Hacker News a link announcing Vim has been ported to iOS.</description>

      <description>As of OSX Lion, I have started to seriously loathe some of the build-it Mac apps (such as Mail, and iCal). While I previously had no issues with them, they now seem to be very clunky and crash quite often. Being a developer, I thought “why don’t I write an app that wraps web apps for you so you basically get “native web apps” that have icons and are launchable?”.</description>

Like many parents, I thought it would be a good idea to get a tablet device for my son so that he could play some educational games and watch some Netflix (in moderation of course). After doing quite a bit of research, I settled on the Kindle Fire.</description>

At the time, I was running my own virtual instance on Rackspace cloud hosting (we’ll get to this momentarily). I also had all of the caching and optimization plugins installed and welcomed the Hacker News traffic.</description>

      <description>As you may have noticed, my blog has a new (much cleaner) theme. For 2012, my blogging goals are to focus much more on content rather than flashy visuals.
I have also minimized my set up to save blogging costs (I now blog for FREE) and to simplify things greatly. Here is my new setup:
Jekyll as my “blog engine” The WPTypo WordPress Theme I ported this to Jekyll GitHub for hosting (it’s free).</description>

      <description>From the first time I saw this effect in the Tweetie (now Twitter for iPhone), I was crazy about it. I had written my own hacks to make something close, but it was always terrible. Within the past few months, I have been using a perfect/elegant solution to this problem called SVProgressHUD.
Using this in your project is as easy as calling:

      <description>With all of the buzz around the iTether App, I figured I’d offer a more permanent solution since Apple will surely yank this soon
Last year, a developer published his code for an http SOCKS proxy called iProxy. This will give your iPhone the ability to create a SOCKS server in which your laptop can connect to via the Bonjur protocol.
Once connect, all of your computer’s http traffic will be routed through the server on your iPhone essentially giving you free tethering.</description>

      <description>I have just released the update to my Centipede clone called Caterpillar. For those of you who don’t know, I am doing a 6 part series on how to create this game over at MobileTuts+.
This update adds some interesting functionality on which I will be blogging about in the near future.
I have added iAds to my cocos2D project and when the iAds fail to serve (which is about 75% of the time), I replace them with Admob ads.</description>

Here were a few of my favorite parts:

      <description>Earlier this year, I jumped ship on WordPress and moved to Jekyll after reading this post on Hacker News. I wanted to be 1337! I wanted to ditch the whale that was WordPress.
Well, it was quite a run, but in the end I decided to revert back to WordPress. Although Jekyll is much faster than WordPress, here were my issues:

      <description>Earlier this year, I launched an application called Smart Lockscreen Creator. It was a pretty simple app that allowed you to add dynamic data (such as weather) to your wallpaper and save it back out to your camera roll. The idea is to improve the functionality of the user’s lockscreen. It did very well on launch (and even made it to #1 in the Israel App Store). At the peak, I was selling about 600 copies per day.</description>

One major change from this year however is, I will be attending as a sponsor. A new company/project (currently in private alpha) will be participating as a sponsor at the conference.
We intend to have a table set up with multiple computers and devices so you can check out our product first hand.</description>

As you may have noticed, I’m a bit of a Pixel Art fanatic and wanted to share with you the tutorials that helped to get me started as well as some sites offering some high quality free pixel art.
Keep in mind that some of these sites have similar content, however they all take a slightly different approach in teaching.</description>

      <description>Have you ever seen a game (such as Tiny Tower) that contains similar sprites that only vary by certain attributes (coloring, shading, accessories, etc…)? I would often wonder how long it would take the artists to create each permutation of these sprites. After discovering that you can call a method on a CCSprite called setColor, I realized how most of this customization is done in code.
This tutorial will be a continuation of my last post about creating your own Bitizen in Photoshop.</description>

      <description>This will be a continuation of my last pixel art tutorial about configuring Photoshop for Pixel Art. For the past month or so, both my wife an I have been pretty addicted to this amazing game called Tiny Tower created by Nimble Bits. The biggest draw for me to this game isn’t the fact that it has great simulation style game mechanics, it’s the fact that it was created using Pixel Art.</description>

As with all iOS (tech books really), my book was almost outdated the moment it hit the shelves due to Apple’s constant SDK release cycle. My book ended with “here is what’s coming in iOS 4…”, and didn’t hit the shelves until after iOS 4 was released.</description>

Recently, I have been dabbling with Corona SDK and have been getting really excited about the possibilities. For those of you who don’t know, Corona SDK is a multi platform game engine that allows you to write your code in Lua and deploy on iOS and Android devices.
Today I want to chat with you about Autonomous Steering Behaviors and show you how I have implemented a few of them in a small game that I’m working on.</description>

      <description>This post is a continuation from my previous post found here.
A MobileSubstrate Tweak? After I completed a basic app that allowed me to send various notification types from my iPhone to my inPulse watch, I quickly realized that this would not work if I wanted to hook into the iPhone’s notification system. A Google search revealed to me that I had to make MobileSubstrate hack to overwrite the default notification functionally.</description>

      <description>Many of you may have seen my tweets or blog posts regarding my development of a native iOS interface for the inPulse Watch. I just wanted to share a bit with you about the development process and talk about my updates moving forward.
What is the inPulse Watch? For those of you who don’t know, the inPulse watch is a programmable wristwatch with a bluetooth controller. It can run a single app at a time on top of it’s firmware that is installed on the watch via a bluetooth interface with your computer.</description>

      <description>Developing for jailbroken is actually quite similar to regular iOS development with one addition. More Power! oh oh oh (said in a Tim Taylor voice (sorry for non-Americans that don’t get the reference)). With your device jailbroken, you have the ability to hook in to pretty much every class that Apple writes allowing you quite a bit of control over the iPhone’s functionality.
In today’s tutorial, I will simply be discussing the best way to get up and running with the tools necessary to write a jailbroken iPhone app.</description>

      <description>As of recent I have had a ton of interest in doing development for Jailbroken iPhones. I love the power, being able to hack anything on the device. It opens up a whole new world of possibilities.
My most current project (inPulseNotifier) is a Mobile Substrate hack which allows the iPhone to interface with an inPulse watch. It uses BTStack and boots up during the init method of your springboard.</description>

      <description>Well, I have finally made the switch from WordPress to Jekyll and couldn’t be happier. Here are some of the bonuses I have seen thus far.
SPEED: Just click around on my site. It is screaming fast now. Resources: Checking top on my server reveals that I have a TON of extra resources (which makes sense since Jekyll sites are way more lightweight). Ease of blogging: Ok, WordPress was pretty easy too, however, I was really starting to get sick of the post interface.</description>

      <description>So, after my 6 year relationship with WordPress, I have been having some strong feelings for another (blog engine). Jekyll does everything that I want my wordpress to do.
Not suck at security Not be bloated Not have a sucky post editor Expense – I have a few blogs hosted on Rackspace and my bill has gotten pretty pricey. I’m hoping to host my Jekyll site on App Engine for frizzle (free).</description>

      <title>Free App Idea: Drop Tunes</title>

      <description>Perhaps this already exists, if so, please link me to it.
The idea
Drop music into your Dropbox folder on your computer. Then open up the app which presents you with an iPod like interface for this music.
The genius
What’s great about it is, you have all of you music on your iPhone without using up disk space. Of course you may need to upgrade your Dropbox account to something greater than 2GBs to see any real value.</description>

      <description>My latest iOS app, Smart Lockscreen Creator has just released on iPhone for $.99.
Download It Here
The Idea Currently your lockscreen on your iOS device is nothing more than a pretty watch with a background. Jailbreakers have solved this issue with an incredible application called intelliscreen, which adds lots of interesting information to it. However, you and I are Apple fanboys and won’t violate our precious iPhones with jailbreaking. Enter Smart Lockscreen Creator.</description>

      <description>Well, I have finally decided to put my money where my mouth is when it comes to fitness and train up for a half marathon! The marathon I’m training for is the Albuquerque Half Marathon on Saturday, April 16th at 8 am (that logo is such an eyesore).
Two months seems like a relatively short time to prepare, especially for my first “real” run, however I am just aiming to finish rather than being competitive.</description>

Make sure you update to the latest version: tweetpress 3.2

      <description>Now, I’m not going to give you a rundown on it as I’m sure that you can (or have already) read it on a website far more popular than mine. I just wanted to publicly geek out for a second…
I was watching the episode of Jeopardy with my wife, and at first glance she was like “duh, of course a computer could win at Jeopardy”. This made me realize that to a non engineer, this seems like a trivial task since computers are magical Facebook boxes.</description>

The Problem Generating the calendar was the easy part, however when displayed, I wanted it to highlight every Monday of the month. This turned out to be a bit trickier than I imagined.</description>

I wanted to thank everyone for letting me be a part of the iDevBlogADay community. You guys have been super supportive and I really appreciate all of the commenting, retweeting, and upvoting of my iDevBlogADay articles.
I have found myself in a position with life (work + family) where I may no longer be able to consistently write a post per week. So, after 2 months of writing, it is time for me to pass the torch to the next blogger on the list.</description>

So, you head to the admin panel of your blogging engine (hopefully WordPress) and begin to write your review. Now, you want to insert some screenshots, icons, descriptions, app store links, etc… So, what do you do? You head on over to Bing and type in google.</description>

After doing a bit of research on the subject, I found countless posts on Stack Overflow and the Developer forums about various methods to get and set the pixel values of a UIImage. Most of them unanswered or partially answered.</description>

      <description>I am always very fascinated with the workspaces of others and frequently check out Lifehacker’s posts on their featured workspaces. So, for this iDevBlogADay post, I thought I would keep it short and simple with a request. I want to see (and I’m sure others do too) photos of YOUR workspaces (especially those of you with standing desks).
Seeing someone’s work area is especially inspring to me, I love seeing where others create and what they surround themselves with for inspiration and motivation.</description>

Recently, I have noticed a few services sprout up that basically have a schedule of apps that shift from paid to free for a given day.</description>

After setting up a blog site for the pastor of my church (http://brownbishop.com), I fell in love with the Standard WordPress Theme. Not only is the theme absolutely beautiful out of the box, it’s also a theme framework giving you TONS of configuration options including custom layouts, social network integration, and analytics integration.</description>

Last night, I was explaining to her all about memory leaks as I had a discussion with a coworker earlier in the day about them. She was curious, so I gave her a very simple explanation in which she could understand.
Later in the night (about 3 am), my son woke up screaming.</description>

Clever Indie developers making money hand over fist while the store as well as developers find their identities. With that being said, I feel that there is a serious lack of interesting (maintained) Twitter clients for OSX. I say “maintained” because Tweetie for OSX is just fantastic, however Twitter said they don’t have any plans for it at this time.</description>

      <description>One thing I always wondered about Core Data is why the compiler would warn you if you didn’t specify the inverse relationship. After reading through Apple’s docs, they essentially say its to make your database more robust by reinforcing those relationships. Plus, you never know when you may have one thing and need to get to the other.
After working on a project with an Enormous Core Data database, I found one very useful thing about inverses.</description>

      <description>This article was a very interesting with some insight into the Android Market. Basically, this indie Android developer has published 6 free applications and is making more than $1,000.00 per month off of advertisements.
None of my apps has been ever promoted in Top of Android Market
I am providing only free apps (mostly due of Android Market limitations)
Even if I would be able to sell apps I would not use it as main income source… (I believe that you still can make more from ads…)</description>

Here are a few that I particularly enjoyed

      <description>I have just posted an update to my plugin Tweetpress! In case you don’t know, Tweetpress is a plugin I created that allows you to post images to your WordPress blog from mobile Twitter clients instead of a 3rd party service like Twitpic. Here is what’s new in this version.</description>

      <description>So another week has gone by and I have made quite a bit of progress, here are the additions since I last posted.
Texturing Lighting Skybox Better Terrain generation Environment Fog Basic navigation So judging by the screenshot, you might really be thinking that I’m working on Minecraft for the iPhone (I used textures that someone created for Minecraft). While this isn’t my intention, it is starting to look like my engine would be perfect for a simple port.</description>

      <description>After a week of studying my butt off with OpenGL ES, I have finally started work on my game engine for my Pov’s Challenge game.
As you can tell from the screenshot below, I have been playing entirely too much Minecraft and have cube art on the brain.
It’s not much right now, but I do have a basic cube rendering engine that takes in a level file and renders the environment.</description>

      <description>The other day, I was reading Ludum Dare and saw a very interesting post. It was a call to action for all game developers to get serious and actually put something out there. Here is a link to the post:
PoV’s Challenge: Make a game, sell 1 copy
The idea is for would-be indie game developers to create a game in the month of October and sell at least one copy.</description>

      <description>Ok, so maybe this is stupid, reposting your own content in multiple areas. As far as SEO goes, it may not be the best idea. However, I really love Tumblr and I really love WordPress. I can’t seem to part with either yet I don’t quite have the time for both.
I put out a quick tweet earlier today (and this is why I flippin love Twitter), asking if anyone knew of a good way to connect WordPress to Twitter.</description>

      <description>I really enjoyed this article on traits of developers.
http://www.turnleafdesign.com/6-traits-of-successful-developers
In my experience, developers tend to become arrogant and totally ignore #1 (see Windows Devs). I feel that this is the most important trait of all.
“For a developer to be successful over any period of time a continued commitment to learning is absolutely vital. The field is too large, too quickly changing, and too in depth for any developer to ever “know it all.</description>

      <description>So I received an internal email at work the other day about how we could SEO our company website (http://elctech.com). Here was my suggestion:
“Just put up a few tags that state (in this order) Rails, Coding, Consulting, Porn, Free Porn, Porn on Rails, Viagra, iPhone, development, hot chicks, elc.
Guaranteed hits!”
Genius right? So after a while, a fellow employee (@maxmurphy) suggested we implement this rails solution:
Perfect!

      <description>If you have a WordPress blog and an iPhone/iPad, then you most likely have the WordPress for iOS app. If you don’t, you should.
Over the past couple of days, I have been receiving the following error when trying to add my blog to the iPhone app.
After scouring the internet, I found that this could be the result of a few issues.
Special characters in a post body that are not supported by NSXMLParser Special characters in a comment Invalid post or comment RSS An error in a theme/plugin file For me, this turned out to be an issue with the comments RSS feed.</description>

      <description>I have updated my WordPress plugin Feedburner Anywhere. In case you are unfamiliar with it, it’s a plugin that allows you to output your Feedburner subscriber count anywhere on your blog.
**The Problem: **Since Google took over Feedburner, I feel that it has been quite unreliable. A few times a week, Feedburner would return 0 for your subscriber count. This was an issue with the plugin. If the return value was 0 when the plugin pulled and cached the feedburner data, you would look like you had no subscribers.</description>

What it does is allow you to display your RSS subscriber count anywhere on your blog.
You have the choice of using the built-in widget, embedding it in your posts/pages, or a combination of both.

      <description>What? Have you ever noticed that the content on Mashable.com loads Incredibly fast? Also, have you noticed that as you scroll the images seem to ‘fade’ in? Well, this isn’t due to some crazy h4x0r code written specifically by Mashable Engineers. It’s a simple JQuery plugin that loads the images ‘Lazily’.
The Jquery plugin can be found here and a nice tutorial for implementing it can be found here.</description>

      <description>The script to do this is actually quite simple and can be used to update any post attribute.
Here is the code:
This will assign the keywords “foo”, “bar”, and “baz” to the post with ID 5. This task seems trivial, however it’s very powerful when you think about automation. For example, you could write a script to scrape a google search for your target keyword and find related keywords for each of your posts automatically.</description>

The Problem As you may have discovered, the wp_query() function isn’t a “one size fit’s all” solution. Often times, you may need to query the WordPress database using a custom MySQL query. Especially if you are using WordPress for anything other than a blog (ie freshapps.</description>

Amazon is now looking to throw their hat into the ring and is releasing their own dev kit for their ever so popular Kindle.
http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html/?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;docId=1000476231
It appears that big name game developers Electronic Arts is also getting involved (WTH?!?!)
This just seems like it will be an epic fail. Who really wants to play video games on their Kindle?</description>

Now, RedBox is pretty stinking cheap ($1.50/night), but if you’re an avid movie watcher, this really adds up.</description>

      <description>To some, this should seem a bit obvious and if I am insulting your intelligence by discussing it, I am sorry. But, one of the main reasons I want to discuss this topic is, I was asked this question in a job interview for Lockheed Martin.
What is the difference between i++ and ++i?
The answer is actually quite simple.
i++ first evaluates the value of i and then increments it ++i increments the value of i and then evaluates it Here is a brief example to demonstrate what I mean.</description>

      <description>So, I though I’d start this series called Programming Tip Of The Day to write about useful things I come across in programming. Both to educate my readers and as a personal archive of ideas and tips.
I will kick it off today with a quick rant about the ternary operator. I &amp;lt;3 the ternary operator. It’s quick, efficient and saves a lot of ugly code.
For those of you who don’t know, the ternary operator is made up of 3 elements: The condition and two results.</description>

      <description>While mashing the keyboard (as I often do when debuggin poorly written outsourced code), I stumbled upon a very useful OSX hotkey.
⌘-option-d This command will cause the Dock to go in and out of auto-hide mode.
Not the most useful, but very helpful to geeks like me who rearrange their desktop every day.</description>

      <description>With the explosion of Twitter and such services, the need to have long URLs shortened has drastically increased. Naturally, many services to shorten URLs have sprung up as well.
Most of these services (that are worth using), have some sort of API that will allow developers to send a long URL to them, have it shortened and then returned. This type of service allows other developers to write applications that have the ability to shorten URLs right inside of them.</description>

      <description>The culture of Digg is generally very liberal (to say the least). That is why I was very surprised to find one of the top stories of the day entitled ”Was Jesus A Real Person?”. Obviously, the comments section of the article was full of people arguing about the matter.
I found the article to be quite well written and made a stellar case for the existence of Jesus. So whether you are a believer or not, you should check it out.</description>

      <description>TweetPress is the WordPress plugin that gives you total control and ownership of the photos you post to Twitter, sending your traffic back to your own blog, instead of a third party site
I just finished development of this WordPress plugin and Andrew Stone of Twittelator has integrated it into his latest version of Twittelator Pro. As of this post, that version is still in review, so you will have to wait until it is approved to make use of TweetPress.</description>

      <description>If you are a serious blogger (and I’m sure you are), you probably track your RSS subscribers with FeedBurner. If you don’t, you should be. One thing that has always bugged me about FeedBurner is if you ever wanted to display the number of subscribers on your blog, you were stuck using their image. The image looks like this:
I’m sure you have seen this logo everywhere. Well, not too many people know it, but FeedBurner actually has a very simple API that allows you to just get the subscriber count so you can display it however you would like.</description>

      <description>If you are doing any Mac, iPhone, HTML5, etc… developement, you have probably had the need for an sqlite database. So, you fire up your Terminal and start manully typing commands to do CREATEs and INSERTs.
You soon realize that this sucks and wish you had something like (shudders) PHPMyAdmin to manage your database. Well, now you do and it’s actually a lot less hiddeous than PHPMyAdmin.
Using the SQLite Manager plugin for Firefox, you can quickly CREATE, MODIFY, and DELETE sqlite databases visually.</description>

      <description>I have long been a fan of Ruby on Rails and even jumper on board very early on. The one thing that has held me back from using it in the majority of my projects is the fact that it’s such a pain to configure with Apache.
I know what you are saying… Just switch to a more Rails friendly server. I like and know Apache. Not to mention I also host PHP apps.</description>

      <description>The Idea: TagACloud is a very unique idea for a website, thus it will take a little explaining to understand all the facets. To take full advantage of the site, you must be the owner or have control over your own website. The idea is to create a tag that represents your website. A tag is a descriptive phrase or a creative tagline describing your site. Once you have added your tag, it gets added to the Tag Cloud.</description>

      <description>So, I started this site called iphonelb.com a few months back and left out a very important feature. The ability to edit your applications!?! What this means is, users have been testing their apps and putting in “test data” and when it comes time for release, the can’t modify it.
Another feature missing, was the ability to clean out all of your test scores.
Well, thanks to about 8 minutes of my time, this has been resolved and the feature has been added.</description>

      <description>Twitter Trends are a very interesting part of Twitter. They are basically the most typed keywords or hashtags on twitter for a given day. Some examples might be #musicmonday or macHeist. These are fun and all but how can you use them to get traffic to my website/blog…
Find Trends That Refer To Articles People Are Linking To? Well, often times trends refer to words associated with website articles, videos, images, etc… For example, the other day, the word mashable was trending on Twitter.</description>

      <description>Ok, so I am sure you have seen this video by now, but I just had to post it because it’s flippin hilarious.
This perfectly describes mine (and others) Twitter obsession. Kinda sad actually.</description>

      <description>I depend on Google way too much for spell checking, simple math, and looking up things I don’t know off the top of my head.
It’s sad because often my first instinct when handwriting something or even looking for a lost object in my house is to “Google it”.</description>

      <description>A few days ago, the popular blogging tool WordPress released a much needed update to their iPhone application. The main features included in the update were:
Landscape mode for writing posts – This is a huge one. It was a total pain in the butt writing blog posts with the vertical keyboard Page Editing/Creation – Meh… How often do you do this? Comment Moderation – Very excited about this feature.</description>

      <description>What makes most multiplayer games more exciting that single player games? It’s competition! People love to compete with eachother.
And how can competition be achieved in single player games? Leaderboards.
A leaderboard is basically a table ranking players based on their scores in the game. This allows players to see how they stack up against other players.
The Problem
Many programmers either know how to do web development or system development.</description>

      <description>It’s been a while, but I finally posted part 3 of the iPhone Game Programming tutorial series on iCodeblog.com. The focus of this tutorial was to create a splash page for your game that fades into your game’s main view.
I chose to create this tutorial after seeing many games that just jump right in to the main game play. A splash page makes the game feel more “professional” as well as gives the developer a chance to brand the app by displaying a company logo or something to that extent.</description>

      <description>So, after downloading many iPhone games and talking with a ton of iphone developers, I have a found a huge need in the community. Over the next week I will be developing a killer web application with a web service API that will be free to iPhone developers to use.
I am not going to give out any details at the moment, but be sure to subscribe to my RSS feed as I will be blogging about it through out next week (Spring Break = Time to develop).</description>

      <description>Note Twitter has switchted their entire interface to use OAUTH and this class no longer works (I should probably change the title hahaha). I will post an oauth connection tutorial in the near future, so make sure to subscribe to my RSS feed for all of the sweet sweets updates!
Cheers!
So, I started writing a Twitter API Programming series last week… Here is part 1. I have found that there is not much else to teach when it comes to interfacing with Twitter.</description>

      <title>Why Many iPhone Apps Suck</title>

      <description>I have been downloading many different iPhone apps lately and have noticed that many of them suck.
When I say they suck, I’m not necesarily referring to the content of the app. What I am talking about is the programming of the app. But Brandon, how do you know the programming sucks. Well, frequent crashing is an obvious indicator. Also, taking too long to do various computations as well as overall awkwardness.</description>

      <description>Well, after anxiously waiting for the past 6 days (feels like forever) I have finally gotten that magical email from Apple stating that my “application is ready for sale”. The application of course referring to a game I created called Buzzword.
Buzzword is essentially a clone of the popular party game CatchPhrase ported on to the iPhone. Click Here for all the details on Buzzword.
I am asking a huge favor to anyone that wants to participate.</description>

      <description>I have recently started using Twitter and completely fell in love with it. Being a programming, this naturally made me want to develop applications for interfacing with it. So, I scoured the internet (checking Twitter’s website as well) to find good *simple tutorials for doing this. After searching for a while, I couldn’t really find any. Ok, I lied, I found a few but they were terrible. I hate tutorials that assume the reader knows more than they actually do.</description>

      <description>If you have ever had your own blog, you may have at one point been faced with a question. How often should I write a blog post and how long should each post be?
I have been thinking about this since I started blogging. It is a common thought that you must write a post every single day in order to increase/maintain traffic. But, is this really true? For busy people with families and lives (that aren’t blogging) might have a tough time writing a new content-rich post every single day.</description>

      <description>Well, it had taken me a while to slot in the time, but I finally finished part 2 of the iPhone Game Programming series iTennis on iCodeBlog.com . The game is shaping up to be pretty cool and I am really enjoying teaching about game programming.
I think that game programming is perfect for teaching people how to program a certain language. This is because games generally encompasses many aspects of programming (interface, logic, math, animation, AI, etc…).</description>

In this fast-paced game, do whatever it takes to get your team to guess the word or phrase. Give them clues – talk, use your hands, jump around. Once they guess, pass it quick. You don’t want to be caught with the game at the buzz.</description>

Here are some screenshots:
Once approved, Buzzword will only cost a buck. I’m not kidding, it will probably be the best dollar you have spent and will spend in your entire life.</description>

      <description>The purpose of this blog will be primarily to share my programming knowledge through coding tutorials.
I will be writing tutorials based on the programming language that I am currently excited about. These will be anywhere from objective-c to ruby on rails to .NET. Whatever strikes my fancy.
Along the road, I will also be sharing my art (photo and drawing) as well as anything else I find interesting.
So just sit back and enjoy the magic of code!</description>
