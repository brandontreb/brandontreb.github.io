         	<p><a href="http://linkshare.com"><img src="/uploads/2009/logo.gif" alt="logo" title="logo"></a></p>
<p>As you may know, I am the developer of the site <a href="http://freshapps.com">FreshApps.com</a>. One thing we had been doing to make some extra money is to use <a href="http://linkshare.com">Linkshare</a> to be an affiliate for Apple.</p>
<p>If you don’t know, <a href="http://linkshare.com">Linkshare</a> is a service that allows you to become an affiliate of thousands of companies. You simply select one of the companies products, get the linkshare link, and put the link on your site. Now, every time someone clicks that link and makes a purchase, you will get a percentage of the revenue.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>The only problem was, we have thousands of apps and converting the links manually seemed like such a daunting process. So, as you can imagine we converted around 10 links and never looked at it again.</p>
<p>Well, earlier today, the designer of the site <a href="http://vanillahd.com">JJ Mancini</a>, asked me to check and see if linkshare had an API. I checked it out and sure enough, they did and it was no more complex than interfacing with a URL shortening service. So, I wrote the script and within minutes, all of our downloads links were converted into something that can now make us some revenue.</p>
<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>
<p>Now that I have created the script, I figured I would pretty it up and share it with you. Keep in mind, the script is stupid easy, so if I am insulting your intelligence by showing it, I apologize.</p>

        } 
    }
 
    print\_r($linkShareLinks);
?&gt;
</code></pre><p>|</p>
<p>And that’s it! The variable $linkShareLinks will now contain all of the App Store links converted to your account’s linkshare url. If you have any site with that contains ads for apps in the app store (review site, developer blog, etc…), you would be crazy not to integrate with linkshare.</p>

         	<p>The culture of Digg is generally very liberal (to say the least). That is why I was very surprised to find one of the top stories of the day entitled ”<a href="http://digg.com/people/Was_Jesus_a_real_person">Was Jesus A Real Person?</a>”. Obviously, the comments section of the article was full of people arguing about the matter.</p>
<p>I found the article to be quite well written and made a stellar case for the existence of Jesus. So whether you are a believer or not, you should check it out. <a href="http://www.y-jesus.com/bornid_1.php?gclid=CMfD2puS_Z0CFRUwpAodl1mgrw">Take a look for yourself</a> and let me know what you think.</p>

        <a href="https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2009/08/10/displaying-your-feedburner-subscriber-count-anywhere-php-coding-tutorial/" class="u-url"><span class="post-meta"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2009-08-10 00:00:00 -0600">Aug 10, 2009</time></span></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p><a href="http://feedburner.com"><img src="/uploads/2009/feedburner-logo1.png" alt="feedburner-logo1" title="feedburner-logo1"></a></p>
<p>If you are a serious blogger (and I’m sure you are), you probably track your RSS subscribers with <a href="http://feedburner.com">FeedBurner</a>. If you don’t, you should be. One thing that has always bugged me about FeedBurner is if you ever wanted to display the number of subscribers on your blog, you were stuck using their image. The image looks like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/brandontreb"><img src="/uploads/2009/brandontreb?bg=99ccff&amp;fg=444444&amp;anim=0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>I’m sure you have seen this logo everywhere. Well, not too many people know it, but FeedBurner actually has a very simple API that allows you to just get the subscriber count so you can display it however you would like.</p>
<p>So rather than being limited to this boring icon, you can display your live subscriber count anywhere on your blog. If you are feeling adventurous, you could even super impose it on to your own custom image using the GD library (tutorial to come if sufficient interest, post in the comments if you would like to see it).</p>
<p>Let’s get started…</p>
<h2 id="1-activate-the-awareness-api-inside-of-feedburner">1. Activate the Awareness API Inside Of Feedburner</h2>
<p>Log in to FeedBurner. Click the <strong>Publicize</strong> tab and the click <strong>Awareness API</strong>. Finally, click <strong>Activate</strong>. The service is now enabled.</p>
<p><a href="http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/awareness_api.jpg"><img src="/uploads/2009/awareness_api.jpg" alt="awareness_api" title="awareness_api"></a></p>
<h2 id="2-write-the-php-code-to-interface-with-feedburner">2. Write The PHP Code To Interface With FeedBurner</h2>
<p>There is a lot of data that you could potentially get from FeedBurner, but the code below will just show you how to get your <strong>subscriber count</strong>.</p>
<p>All you need to do is make a simple GET request using CURL to the URL <a href="https://feedburner.google.com/api/awareness/1.0/GetFeedData?uri=brandontreb">https://feedburner.google.com/api/awareness/1.0/GetFeedData?uri=brandontreb</a> . Of course replacing <strong>brandontreb</strong> with your feed’s name.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&lt;code class=’php’&gt;&lt;?php
$url = “&lt;https://feedburner.google.com/api/awareness/1.0/GetFeedData?uri=brandontreb&gt;”;
$ch = curl\_init();
curl\_setopt($ch, CURLOPT\_RETURNTRANSFER, 1);
curl\_setopt($ch, CURLOPT\_URL, $url);
$data = curl\_exec($ch);
curl\_close($ch);  

if ($data) {
echo $data;
preg\_match(‘/circulation=&#34;([0-9]+)&#34;/’,$data, $matches);
if ($matches[1](http://feedburner.com) != 0) {
$subscriberCount = $matches[1](http://feedburner.com);
}
}


echo “Join the other $subscriberCount people and subscriber to my RSS feed.”


?&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
</code></pre><p>This code is pretty straight forward with a little trickiness to parse the XML. We first make a <a href="http://us3.php.net/curl">CURL</a> connection to the URL. Just replace <strong>brandontreb</strong> with the title of your RSS feed inside of FeedBurner.</p>
<p>Next we print the data. Note: You won’t see the data in your browser unless you do a <strong>view source</strong>. Since it is XML, your browser will treat it like HTML and not display it. So, we do a <a href="http://us3.php.net/manual/en/function.preg-match.php">preg_match</a> for the element <strong>circulation</strong> and get it’s value. (Pretty sick right?). The value of our <strong>subscriber count</strong> will be at index 1 of the matches array.</p>
<p>Then, we just print the subscriber count and voila!</p>
<p>Now, you are no longer a slave to that generic FeedBurner subscriber count icon. Be sure to <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/feedburner/awareness_api.html">check out their API</a> for other cool things that you can do with their web services. If you have any questions, feel free to leave them in the comments section of this post. Happy Coding!</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>If you are doing any Mac, iPhone, HTML5, etc… developement, you have probably had the need for an sqlite database. So, you fire up your Terminal and start manully typing commands to do CREATEs and INSERTs.</p>
<p>You soon realize that this sucks and wish you had something like (<em>shudders</em>) PHPMyAdmin to manage your database. Well, now you do and it’s actually a lot less hiddeous than PHPMyAdmin.</p>
<p>Using the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/5817">SQLite Manager plugin</a> for Firefox, you can quickly CREATE, MODIFY, and DELETE sqlite databases visually. It’s very simple to use and makes the task of database creation a lot less painful.</p>
<p><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/5817"><img src="/uploads/2009/sqlitemanager-500x375.png" alt="sqlitemanager" title="sqlitemanager"></a></p>
<p>Here the description from the plugin site.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Manage any SQLite database on your computer. An intuitive heirarchical tree showing database objects. Helpful dialogs to manage tables, indexes, views and triggers. You can browse and search the tables, as well as add, edit, delete and duplicate the records. Facility to execute any sql query. The views can be searched too. A dropdown menu helps with the sql syntax thus making writing sql easier. Easy access to common operations through menu, toolbars, buttons and context-menu. Export tables/views/database in csv/xml/sql format. Import from csv/xml/sql (both UTF-8 and UTF-16). Possible to execute multiple sql statements in Execute tab. You can save the queries. Support for ADS on Windows.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p><a href="http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/rails1.png"><img src="/uploads/2009/rails1-391x500.png" alt="rails" title="rails"></a>I have long been a fan of Ruby on Rails and even jumper on board very early on. The one thing that has held me back from using it in the majority of my projects is the fact that it’s such a pain to configure with Apache.</p>
<p>I know what you are saying… Just switch to a more Rails friendly server. I like and know Apache. Not to mention I also host PHP apps.</p>
<p>With the (re)release of tagacloud, I have recently fell in love with ruby on rails again. So, I looked for a better solution for installation (last time I installed it was 3 years ago) and I stumbled upon <a href="http://www.modrails.com/">Passenger</a>.</p>
<p>It was super easy to use and had my running on Rails in no time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Deployment is only a matter of uploading application files. No Ruby (on Rails)-specific server configuration required!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just to give you some background, here are some details about my server.</p>
<p><strong>OS:</strong> Linux</p>
<p><strong>Distribution:</strong> Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 5.3 Hosted At Server Beach</p>
<p><strong>Control Panel:</strong> Plesk 8.6</p>
<p>And here are the steps I took to get Ruby on Rails up and running from scratch</p>
<h2 id="1-install-ruby">1. Install Ruby</h2>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&lt;code class=’bash’&gt;yum install ruby ruby-libs ruby-mode ruby-rdoc ruby-irb ruby-ri ruby-docs&lt;/code&gt;
</code></pre><p>This will do some magic and install Ruby on your system…</p>
<h2 id="2-download-and-install-ruby-gems">2. Download And Install Ruby Gems</h2>
<p>Head on over to <a href="http://rubygems.org/">http://rubygems.org/</a> and download the latest version of Ruby Gems. Here is an example of getting the latest version as of the posting date of this article.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&lt;code class=’bash’&gt;wget http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/60718/rubygems-1.3.5.tgz&lt;/code&gt;
</code></pre><p>Untar this file…</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&lt;code class=’bash’&gt;tar -xvf rubygems-1.3.5.tgz&lt;/code&gt;
</code></pre><p>Navigate to the extracted directory and run the setup script</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&lt;code class=’bash’&gt;ruby setup.rb&lt;/code&gt;
</code></pre><h2 id="3-install-rails">3. Install Rails</h2>
<p>This will install rails. If it asks you about dependencies, just type “Y”</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&lt;code class=’bash’&gt;gem install rails&lt;/code&gt;
</code></pre><h2 id="4-install-the-passenger-gem">4. Install The Passenger Gem</h2>
<p>Now that rails has been installed, we need to install <a href="http://www.modrails.com/">Passenger</a>. The installation process is stupid simple. <a href="http://www.modrails.com/">Passenger</a> can be installed via a Ruby Gem.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&lt;code class=’bash’&gt;gem install passenger&lt;/code&gt;
</code></pre><p>Now, it will do some stuff and and you some questions. At some point in the process, it will check to see if you have all of the dependencies. <strong>You most likely will not</strong>. Luckily, the geniuses who created Passenger tell you the commands to install all of the dependencies. So just follow the directions and you should be ok.</p>
<h2 id="5-set-up-passenger-for-apache">5. Set Up Passenger For Apache</h2>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&lt;code class=’bash’&gt;passenger-install-apache2-module&lt;/code&gt;
</code></pre><p>It will ask you more questions and install everything needed to run Passenger. Pay attention to the stuff spit out at the end of the process. You will take this and paste it into your httpd.conf file. For example, here is the what mine spit out:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&lt;code class=’bash’&gt;LoadModule passenger_module /usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/passenger-2.2.4/ext/apache2/mod_passenger.so
PassengerRoot /usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/passenger-2.2.4

        <a href="https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2009/07/22/tagacloud-com-relaunched/" class="u-url"><span class="post-meta"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2009-07-22 00:00:00 -0600">Jul 22, 2009</time></span></a>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p><a href="http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/tagAcloud-ad1.gif"><img src="/uploads/2009/tagAcloud-ad1-500x188.gif" alt="tagAcloud-ad" title="tagAcloud-ad"></a></p>
<p>So in 2006, my buddy JJ and I took some inspiration from the <a href="http://www.milliondollarhomepage.com/">Million Dollar Homepage</a> and decided to create a totally inovative Web 2.0 site that works on the same principle. That is when we came up with the idea for <a href="http://tagacloud.com">tagacloud.com</a>.</p>
<p>Tagacloud is a simple concept that uses the fact that people are obsessed with stats to make a fun game that will also direct traffic to your site. Here is how it works (from the <a href="http://www.tagacloud.com/help/instructions">website</a>)…</p>
<h3 id="the-idea">The Idea:</h3>
<p>TagACloud is a very unique idea for a website, thus it will take a little explaining to understand all the facets. To take full advantage of the site, you must be the owner or have control over your own website. The idea is to create a tag that represents your website. A tag is a descriptive phrase or a creative tagline describing your site. Once you have added your tag, it gets added to the Tag Cloud. This is where all the fun begins.</p>
<h3 id="the-goal">The Goal:</h3>
<p>The goal is simple. Become the biggest freakin’ tag on the TagACloud website. The bigger the tag, the more hits it gets. It is that simple.</p>
<h3 id="how-your-tag-gets-bigger">How Your Tag Gets Bigger:</h3>
<p>Your tag gets bigger every time it levels up! And the only way to get your tag to level up is by accumulating points. Points can be acquired in many different ways, but the two primary ways to acquire points are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get Clicked: your tag gets 1 point for every click that your tag receives.</li>
<li>Incoming Hits: your tag gets 2 points for every hit you send to your tag on <a href="http://TagACloud.com">TagACloud.com</a>. You can get tag specific code via your “Get Tag Code” page.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="how-your-tag-gets-hits">How Your Tag Gets Hits</h3>
<p>We provide visitors several ways to find your tag:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Home Page: The home page features 200 random tags in random order.</li>
<li>Popular Tags: If your tag is one of the 200 most popular today, the last 7 days, last month, or of all time; it will be featured in order of popularity on the applicable page.</li>
<li>Keywords: Keywords are essential for any tag that wants to generate hits. Keywords are like user defined categories. We combine all the tags that share common keywords. For example, <a href="http://google.com">google.com</a>, <a href="http://yahoo.com">yahoo.com</a>, and <a href="http://vanillasasquatch.com">vanillasasquatch.com</a> would all share the keyword, SearchEngine. Each tag can have up to 3 keywords associated with it.</li>
<li>The Randomizer: The title says it all. A user can view a random tag’s website, or view a random keyword.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="statistics">Statistics</h3>
<p>There are 3 big addictions on the web. Without sharing the top 2, we will let you know #3, is statistics. People love to view the stats on anything and everything. Here at TagACloud, we will make sure not to disappoint. You will be able to view statistics for every little thing, to ensure that you always know the current state of your tag. You will also find the website itself is littered with stats. Just keep your eyes open.</p>
<p><a href="../wp-content/uploads/2009/07/tagacloud.jpg"><img src="/uploads/2009/tagacloud.jpg" alt="tagacloud" title="tagacloud"></a></p>
<p>As of late 2007, Tagacloud was booming with over <strong>10,000 users</strong>. Then, one day JJ and I decided we would take a weekend and “improve” tagacloud. Now, if any of you are programmers, you know “improving” an app takes much longer than you anticipate.</p>
<p>We set out to do it in a weekend and the ideas started flowing. It was Facebook meets Halo 3 meets Digg meets Hannah Montanna meets Karate Kid 3… And then the weekend ended and Tagacloud would remain a “Coming Soon” page for a year and a half… <img src="/uploads/2009/frownie.png" alt=":("></p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago, JJ and I were sitting around and thought to ourselves “Why did we ever take down the old tagacloud?”. One thing led to another and we decided to completely wipe the database and start tagacloud fresh.</p>
<p>So, go fourth and start <a href="http://tagacloud.com">leveling your tag</a>.</p>

         	<p>I was a big fan of the game Alice that came out for PC. It def portrayed AIW as a darker sort of movie. It looks like Tim Burton will add a similar twist to the latest Alice In Wonderland Movie. Check out the trailer above.</p>

<p>So, I started this site called <a href="http://iphonelb.com">iphonelb.com</a> a few months back and left out a very important feature. The ability to edit your applications!?! What this means is, users have been testing their apps and putting in “test data” and when it comes time for release, the can’t modify it.</p>
<p>Another feature missing, was the ability to clean out all of your test scores.</p>
<p>Well, thanks to about 8 minutes of my time, this has been resolved and the feature has been added. I am really excited about iphonelb and have some big things planned for it in the future. <a href="http://twitter.com/brandontreb">Write me on Twitter</a> or on my blog if you have any feature requests for it.</p>

<p>After seeing the show Parks and Recreation last night, I have come to the conclusion that the show is doomed to fail. Not only is it not funny, it’s jokes try to mimic the dry awkward humor of The Office. Parks and Recreation Fail!</p>

<p>Twitter Trends are a very interesting part of Twitter. They are basically the most typed keywords or <a href="http://twitter.pbwiki.com/Hashtags">hashtags</a> on twitter for a given day. Some examples might be <a href="http://twitter.com/timeline/search?q=%23musicmonday&amp;source=sidebar&amp;category=trends">#musicmonday</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/timeline/search?q=MacHeist&amp;source=sidebar&amp;category=trends">macHeist</a>. These are fun and all but how can you use them to get traffic to my website/blog…</p>
<h2 id="find-trends-that-refer-to-articles-people-are-linking-to">Find Trends That Refer To Articles People Are Linking To?</h2>
<p>Well, often times trends refer to words associated with website articles, videos, images, etc… For example, the other day, the word mashable was trending on Twitter. This was because <a href="http://Mashable.com">Mashable.com</a> had just put out an <a href="http://mashable.com/2009/04/04/twitter-trends/">article</a> on twitter trends. Since people were talking about and more importantly <strong>linking to</strong> this article, the word mashtable was trending…Naturally, this article got quite a bit of traffic.</p>
<h2 id="post-a-comment-on-the-article">Post a Comment On The Article</h2>
<p>So, I commented on the article leaving a link to my blog. That day, I got ~50 extra uniques to my blog! You can do the same by closely following the trends. Make sure you read the article and are not just spamming the comments section. Many articles use blog systems (such as WordPress) that allow you to link to your website/blog in your commentsl. Post a comment that contributes to the discussion and I guaruntee it will generate more traffic to your website/blog. Again, don’t be a spammer, contribute something to the discussion…</p>
<h2 id="be-prompt-comment-early">Be Prompt (comment early)</h2>
<p>The sooner you comment on the article, the more traffic it will generate to your site. In the above example, I was like the 15th or 16th to commenter. Imagine if I had been the first…</p>
<p>Although this method isn’t perfect, it’s a sure fire way to generate some quick traffic for your blog/website. Do this every day, and you could be huge!</p>

<p>If you have a blog/website then you probably have heard of <a href="http://alexa.com">Alexa</a>. If not, you should search your blog in it to find out some interesting stats. Being a stat junkie, I check services like this frequently.</p>
<p>It appears that Alexa has recently updated their interface from their old jenk <strong>web .05</strong> hideousness. While it’s not quite <strong>web 2.0</strong>, I’d say it has a good start as web 1.6 (maybe 1.7 because of the shine on the logo).</p>
<p>On a side note, icodeblog seems to be huge in Canada 😉</p>

<p><strong><strong>Note</strong></strong> <strong>Twitter has switchted their entire interface to use OAUTH and this class no longer works (I should probably change the title hahaha).

<p><strong>Cheers!</strong></p>
<p>So, I started writing a Twitter API Programming series last week… <a href="http://brandontreb.com/twitter-api-programming-tutorial-with-php-getting-started/">Here is part 1</a>. I have found that there is not much else to teach when it comes to interfacing with Twitter. Basically, we just need to implement all of the Twitter functions.</p>
<p>I have taken it upon myself to create a fully functional <strong>Twitter API PHP class</strong>. It has every Twitter function you will ever need (less the direct messages). I have also fully documented it with comments directly from the Twitter API so that the functions are easy to understand. Here is how you would use the class. The first parameter of every function is the return type. For Twitter it can be either xml, json, or rss for some functions.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&lt;code class=’php’&gt;include(&#34;Twitter.class.php&#34;);
    $twitter = new Twitter();
    $twitter-&gt;username = &#34;twitteruser&#34;;
    $twitter-&gt;password = &#34;twitterpass&#34;;
    // Show public timeline
    echo $twitter-&gt;public_timeline();
    // Update your status
    echo $twitter-&gt;update(‘xml’,’This PHP class is flippin sweet!’);
    // Start following a user
    echo $twitter-&gt;create(‘xml’,’brandontreb’);&lt;/code&gt;
</code></pre><p>These are just 3 of the functions implemented in this class. The full function list includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>public_timeline</li>
<li>friends_timeline</li>
<li>user_timeline</li>
<li>update</li>
<li>replies</li>
<li>friends</li>
<li>followers</li>
<li>show</li>
<li>create</li>
<li>destroy</li>
<li>exists</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these functions are fully documented and simple to use. You can also check out Twitter’s API <a href="http://apiwiki.twitter.com/REST+API+Documentation">here</a> (but you shouldn’t need to).</p>
<p>So, now you can fully **integrate Twitter into any PHP application you create! **</p>

<p>I have recently started using Twitter and completely fell in love with it. Being a programming, this naturally made me want to develop applications for interfacing with it. So, I scoured the internet (checking Twitter’s website as well) to find good *simple tutorials for doing this. After searching for a while, I couldn’t really find any. Ok, I lied, I found a few but they were terrible. I hate tutorials that assume the reader knows more than they actually do.</p>
<p>So, I am taking it upon myself to write a series of comprehensive tutorials for interfacing with Twitter. I will first do them all in PHP and then maybe in some other languages. I may even do some in Objective-C to be implemented on the iPhone. These would be written of course at <a href="http://iCodeBlog.com">iCodeBlog.com</a> 😉 .</p>
<p>Let’s just jump right in. Twitter offers a few ways to interface with their web services, which are all documented on their <a href="http://apiwiki.twitter.com/">API Wiki</a>. The documentation is great, assuming you know the code to get connected and make the calls. So, let’s skip all of the nerdy low level stuff and write an application.</p>
<p>Today, I will be teaching you how to simply connect to Twitter and update your status. This will be pretty straight forward and require very little PHP code. So, grab some coffee, open up your favorite PHP editor (notepad?).</p>
<p>Ok, so let’s start by wrapping our code into an easy to call function. We don’t want to have to copy and paste our Twitter interface code every time we need it in a project. Wouldn’t it be nice if we could just call it like this</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&lt;code class=’php’&gt;updateTwitter(&#34;Just Rockin Out&#34;)&lt;/code&gt;
</code></pre><p>So let’s begin by declaring a function called <strong>updateTwitter</strong>. Type the following code</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&lt;code class=’php’&gt;function updateTwitter($status){ 
    // Twitter login information 
    $username = &#34;TwitterUsername&#34;; 
    $password = &#34;TwitterPassword&#34;;&lt;/code&gt;
</code></pre><p>Our function begins with a declaration of a username and password. This will be <em>your</em> Twitter login information. Every Twitter API call requires that you authenticate yourself. Make sure you update the code to include <em>your</em> username and password/</p>
<p>Next, we will add the following code to initialize the variables needed to make our Twitter API call. Continue by adding the following code.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&lt;code class=’php’&gt;// The url of the update function 
    $url = ‘http://twitter.com/statuses/update.xml’; 
    // Arguments we are posting to Twitter 
    $postargs = ‘status=’.urlencode($status); 
    // Will store the response we get from Twitter 
    $responseInfo=array(); 
    // Initialize CURL 
    $ch = curl_init($url);&lt;/code&gt;
</code></pre><p>One thing I want to point out is the URL. Notice the update.xml at the end of it. This is telling the Twitter API we want to call the <strong>update</strong> function and we expect to receive <strong>xml</strong> back. You could also change it to be <strong>update.json</strong> if you want to receive json data back.</p>
<p>The next variable <strong>postargs</strong> is simply the arguments we will pass to the update function. Since these arguments get appended to the URL, they need to be urlencoded. The <strong>responseInfo</strong> array will contain the return data from the cURL request to Twitter. Finally, we just initialize a new cURL session. cURL is just a protocol for transferring data. You can read up on it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL">on Wikipedia</a> if you feel so inclined.</p>
<p>Next, we need to tell cURL to do a POST rather than a GET and pass it our argument string</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&lt;code class=’php’&gt;// Tell CURL we are doing a POST 
    curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true); 
    // Give CURL the arguments in the POST 
    curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $postargs);&lt;/code&gt;
</code></pre><p>The next part is where the magic happens. Here is the next bit of code (I’ll explain it below)…</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&lt;code class=’php’&gt;// Set the username and password in the CURL call 
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_USERPWD, $username.’:’.$password); 
    // Set some cur flags (not too important) 
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_VERBOSE, 1); 
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_NOBODY, 0); 
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HEADER, 0); 
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION,1); 
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1); 
    // execute the CURL call 
    $response = curl_exec($ch); 
    // Get information about the response 
    $responseInfo=curl_getinfo($ch); 
    // Close the CURL connection curl_close($ch);&lt;/code&gt;
</code></pre><p>Wow! that looks like a lot of nerdy code. Good thing you only have to write it once and don’t have to understand it (unless you want to). The first line sets the username and password fields in our cURL call. When we first connect with the Twitter API, it will prompt for a username and password. cURL will automatically feed the username and password to the API.  The next few lines are not super important. If you one of those people that get hung up on that sort of thing, you can read about them <a href="http://us.php.net/curl">here</a>. We’re almost done, I promise… Finally, we make the cURL call itself by calling curl_exec. This will return a response <strong>from Twitter</strong> which will contains some XML if your call completed successfully. The next line, gets the http response (makes sure you were able to connect to Twitter). If it is anything other than 200 (HTTP OK), it means your cURL request never even reached Twitter. Here is the last bit of code</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&lt;code class=’php’&gt;// Make sure we received a response from Twitter 
    if(intval($responseInfo[‘http_code’])==200){ 
        // Display the response from Twitter 
        echo $response; 
    }else{ 
        // Something went wrong 
        echo &#34;Error: &#34; . $responseInfo[‘http_code’]; 
    } 
} 
?&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
</code></pre><p>All this code really does is makes sure we got a 200 code (successfully reached Twitter). If so, it prints out the XML that Twitter returned to us.  Now you have a handy-dandy function you can call whenever we want to update your Twitter status from your website. Simply type</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&lt;code class=’php’&gt;updateTwitter(&#34;Just finished a sweet tutorial on http://brandontreb.com&#34;)&lt;/code&gt;
</code></pre><p>and like magic, your Twitter status will be updated. This has many different uses as you can imagine. Join me next time when I will be putting this code into a PHP class as well as implementing the rest of the Twitter API functions. We will then be able to use this Twitter class in a variety of PHP applications.

         	<p>If you have ever had your own blog, you may have at one point been faced with a question. How often should I write a blog post and how long should each post be?</p>
<p>I have been thinking about this since I started blogging. It is a common thought that you must write a post every single day in order to increase/maintain traffic. But, is this really true? For busy people with families and lives (that aren’t blogging) might have a tough time writing a new content-rich post every single day.</p>
<p>So, would readers rather see less frequent but “better” blog posts or more frequent “weaker” blog posts? Or maybe even a combo of the two?</p>
<p>For example, what if between killer programming tutorials, I wrote short posts about my dog or response to popular articles. Would this benefit my readers or turn them off?</p>
<p>I don’t have a real solution to this but plan to employ some of these strategies while writing this blog. Hopefully, I will be able to draw some conclusions and share them. If you happen to stumble on this post on your journey through the interwebz, please feel free to comment and shed some light on this for me.</p>

         	<p>With the growing popularity of both Twitter and Facebook, one could obviously see a need to link them together. Whether you primarily use Twitter or Facebook, this tutorial will show you step by step, how to update your Facebook status by posting to your Twitter account.</p>
<p>So, how can you update your Facebook status with a text message? Well, Twitter offers this great functionality that allows you to post a “Tweet” via text message. If you combine this with the Twitter app that Facebook offers, you can now update your Facebook and Twitter status simultaneously with one text message (no internet required).</p>
<p>What you will need:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> Account</li>
<li><a href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</a> Account</li>
<li>Cell Phone Capable of Sending Text Messages</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="signing-up-for-twitter">Signing Up For Twitter</h3>
<p>The first step is to sign up for a Twitter account if you don’t already have one. Head on over to <a href="http://twitter.com/signup">http://twitter.com/signup</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/signup"><img src="/uploads/2009/picture-11.png" alt="Twitter" title="Twitter"></a></p>
<h3 id="setting-up-text-message-updates-on-twitter">Setting Up Text Message Updates On Twitter</h3>
<p>You first need to tell Twitter that you want to post from your phone. Start by clicking on <strong>Settings</strong> in the top right corner of your Twitter page.</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/2009/picture-2.png" alt="Settings" title="Settings"></p>
<p>Now, select the <strong>Devices</strong> tab</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/2009/picture-13.png" alt="picture-13" title="picture-13"></p>
<p>Enter in your phone number with a “+” in front of it, followed by the country code. So for US phone numbers, it’s +1… Look at the image below for an example.</p>
<p><img src="/uploads/2009/picture-3.png" alt="picture-3" title="picture-3"></p>
<p>Twitter will then send your phone a text message containing a unique code. Once you get it, enter it in the box. Now you are able to update your Twitter status by sending a text message to <strong>40404</strong>. Whatever you send to this number will be posted to Twitter.</p>
<h3 id="connecting-facebook-to-twitter">Connecting Facebook to Twitter</h3>
<p>Now, you simply need to install the Twitter application on your Facebook account. Log in to Facebook and go to <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?sid=c23a2e7431ca430d5a5ffe3b1008192e&amp;id=2231777543&amp;ref=s">Twitter’s application</a>. You can find it by <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?sid=c23a2e7431ca430d5a5ffe3b1008192e&amp;id=2231777543&amp;ref=s">clicking here</a> or searching for “Twitter” in the search bar. Once on Twitter’s page click “Go to Application”</p>
<p><a href="http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/picture-14.png"><img src="/uploads/2009/picture-14.png" alt="picture-14" title="picture-14"></a></p>
<p>It will ask you if you want to allow access to the Twitter application on Facebook. Click “Allow”</p>
<p><a href="http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/picture-31.png"><img src="/uploads/2009/picture-31-300x168.png" alt="picture-31" title="picture-31"></a></p>
<p>Now it will ask you to enter your Twitter user name and password. Enter it in and click “Log In”</p>
<p><a href="http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/picture-4.png"><img src="/uploads/2009/picture-4-300x107.png" alt="picture-4" title="picture-4"></a></p>
<p>Now, click on “Allow Twitter To Update Your Facebook Status”</p>
<p><a href="http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/picture-5.png"><img src="/uploads/2009/picture-5-300x47.png" alt="picture-5" title="picture-5"></a></p>
<p>The next screen will confirm. Click “Allow” and you are good to go!</p>
<p>There you have it! It sounds a little complicated, but trust me, updating your Facebook status via text message is very handy. You don’t even have to look at your Twitter account every again (although you should because Twitter is rad). If you have any questions or comments, feel free to leave them in the comments section of this post.</p>

<p>In this fast-paced game, do whatever it takes to get your team to guess the word or phrase. Give them clues – talk, use your hands, jump around. Once they guess, pass it quick. You don’t want to be caught with the game at the buzz.</p>
<h3 id="game-controls">Game Controls:</h3>
<p><strong>Start/Stop</strong> – Starts and stops the timer</p>
<p>**Category **– Selects a category</p>
<p><strong>Team1</strong> – Awards a point to team 1</p>
<p><strong>Team 2</strong> – Awards a point to team 2</p>
<p>**Next **– Selects the next word to describe</p>
<h3 id="game-rules">Game Rules:</h3>
<p>To play the game, players need to split up into two teams. You should sit in a circle alternating every other person as a member on your team.</p>
<p>First, the teams will need to decide on a category in which the words will come from. This is done by pressing the “Category” button. Next, pick a team to begin the game with the first word.</p>
<p>The game starts by pressing the “start/stop” button to start the timer. The player holding the iPhone/iPod will try to describe the word on the screen. They can say and do whatever they want without saying any of the words on the screen, saying “rhymes with”, or saying “starts with”. All of the members on their team will then try to guess the word or phrase the player is trying to describe.</p>
<p>Once the word has been guessed, the iPhone/iPod is passed to the next player on the opposite team. This player will press the “Next” button to receive a new word to describe.</p>
<p>The game is played until the buzzer goes off. At this point, the team NOT holding the iPhone/iPod gets a point. This is done by pressing either the “Team 1” or “Team 2” buttons. The first team to 7 wins!</p>
