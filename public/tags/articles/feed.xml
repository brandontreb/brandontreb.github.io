      <title>Trying Something New</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&#34;http://micro.blog&#34;&gt;micro.blog&lt;/a&gt; is pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have recently been thinking about my process of blogging / tweeting / facebooking / etc… and have realized that I’m burnt out on all three. I LOVE to write. I started one of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20090202061853/http://icodeblog.com&#34;&gt;first successful iOS Blogs&lt;/a&gt;, published numerous (software development books)[&lt;a href=&#34;http://manning.com/trebitowski&#34;&gt;http://manning.com/trebitowski&lt;/a&gt;], and have been blogging since 2008. Here are a bit of thoughts about the various platforms and ultimately my solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;twitter&#34;&gt;twitter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having over 4,000 followers on &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/brandontreb&#34;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; I used to find tremendous value in the platform. There was a time when I would ask a programming question and get 20+ responses within 10 minutes. I’m not sure if legit people have stopped following me or have stopped using the platform, but I am no longer getting any engagement. I probably have like 20 followers and 3,800 spam bots at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;blogging&#34;&gt;blogging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, blogging has always had to be long-form. Maybe it’s just my wannabe Tim Ferris mindset, but this has held me back from writing for quite a long time. I would wait until I had a long (usually 1K words +) post before writing anything. So, it other words, perpetual writers block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;facebook&#34;&gt;facebook&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t even get me started. I jumped on the &lt;strong&gt;#deleteFacebook&lt;/strong&gt; bandwagon months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://deletefacebook.com/&#34;&gt;#deleteFacebook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;microblog&#34;&gt;micro.blog&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I discovered &lt;a href=&#34;http://manton.org&#34;&gt;Manton Reece’s&lt;/a&gt; new platform called &lt;a href=&#34;micro.blog&#34;&gt;http://micro.blog&lt;/a&gt;. I guess the platform isn’t necessarily &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; as he launched in 2015, but after using it, it still feels like it’s in the new/exciting phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manton describes perfectly why he created the platform &lt;a href=&#34;http://help.micro.blog/2015/why-i-created-this/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and this captures my thoughts exactly on the content-creation ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some things that I’m super excited about the micro.blog platform:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You post to &lt;strong&gt;your own&lt;/strong&gt; site, keeping all the content controlled by &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can also pay $5 monthly for a hosted blog. This means their business is built on an actual product rather than advertising revenue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s built on RSS. I have always been a huge RSS fan and am glad to see a resurgence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s full of developers that I already know/admire. Guys like &lt;a href=&#34;http://micro.blog/manton&#34;&gt;@manton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://micro.blog/collin&#34;&gt;@collin&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://micro.blog/gruber&#34;&gt;@gruber&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s incredibly social. The platform really encourages conversation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No follower count. This is arguably the best part. No one (including yourself) can see your follower count. This allows you the feeling to just create and not worry about the vanity of the whole thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still plan on using Twitter to some extent, but my primary source of content publishing will/should be &lt;strong&gt;this blog&lt;/strong&gt;. It will become a mix of my long-form posts and my “tweet-sized” snarky comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this sounds even slightly interesting to you, def check it out and follow me on &lt;a href=&#34;http://eepurl.com/bnryI5&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; or on &lt;a href=&#34;http://micro.blog/brandontreb&#34;&gt;micro.blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How Creating A Call Flow Can Help Your Software Sales Calls</title>
      <link>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2017/04/07/how-creating-a-call-flow-helps-sales-calls/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 07 Apr 2017 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate>
      <author>brandontreb@gmail.com (|ZeroCool|)</author><guid>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2017/04/07/how-creating-a-call-flow-helps-sales-calls/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2008, I was still in college. I had just landed my first job with a small consultancy as their first iOS developer replacing their outsourced Ukrainian team. Within my first week on the job, the CEO asked me to jump on a sales call as the technical lead. This absolutely terrified me. I remember doing things like ensuring that I had a full glass of water so my throat wouldn’t get so dry (it still did). I also stumbled over my words, almost costing the team many sales. Eventually, I learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since that day, I have taken hundreds of software sales calls. Each time trying to improve my process by testing out what works and what doesn’t. Now that I run my own company, I have found that one of the most beneficial things that I have done is implemented a standard call flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a reason that call centers require their employees to memorize call flows. When you have a call flow in place, it does a few things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-it-allows-you-to-practice-and-refine-your-pitch-over-and-over-again&#34;&gt;1. It allows you to practice and refine your pitch over and over again.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practice makes perfect. Definitely cliche, but it makes a lot of sense here. As you give your pitch over and over again, you will start to pair it down to something that works for you and your team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-it-builds-confidence&#34;&gt;2. It builds confidence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people are nervous speaking to strangers. Software developers are no exception to this. As I mentioned above, I was terrified on my first few sales calls. This had a lot to do with the fact that I was ‘shooting from the hip’ and just trying to make things up as I went along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I finally got a script in place, I was able to lean on it during future calls. This gave me the confidence that I was gathering all of the right information and representing myself in the best way possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now when someone says “Could I see an example of your work?”, I can quickly shoot them a link or list rather than nervously trying to get the words out “well…uh…I made an app about catz, and I’ll find the link and…uhhh… send it to you later…”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;3-its-so-easy-a-sales-guy-can-do-it&#34;&gt;3. It’s so easy a ‘sales guy’ can do it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the part that I’m starting to experiment with. I want my pitch for my company to be so tight, that I could give it to any ‘sales guy’ to deliver and him represent Pixegon in much the same way I would. I have already done this with some of my engineers as I don’t always have time to make every single sales call and it has proven to be a huge success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;4-it-removes-emotion&#34;&gt;4. It removes emotion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a big one. When we are nervous, we tend to say dumb things. I remember a few times on sales calls when I was nervous (often because I really wanted/needed the contract), that I would seriously compromise on my rate just because the client suggested it. Had I had a call flow in font of me, I would have been better prepared to field such a request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I now replace emotion with process and it usually ends up better for both parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sample-flow&#34;&gt;Sample Flow&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a rough outline of my sample call flow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Client Introduction - Ask the client about their background&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How did you find us? Good to find out what advertising channels are working&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Give my background - This is to establish credentials so they trust me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask the client to give a 10,000’ overview of the project - Be careful here, they love to get in the weeds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 3 most important questions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What’s your budget? This will let you know right away if you want to continue much further based on your budget tolerance and rough guess on how much the above will cost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What’s your timeline? Every single client will say ASAP. But really this is to find out if there are any conferences, holidays, etc… that are hard deadlines for them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How are you funding this project? Self, Company, VC, Family, Startup, etc… This will also help you assess risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask more detailed questions about the project (If timeline / budget are somewhat ok). Determine things like backend requirements, UI/UX, Staff aug vs full solution, etc…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t give them a $$$ estimate. They will usually ask you and it will usually cost you in the end if you give them a number here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If all goes well, ask them to send over any assets/wires/requirements and tell them you will follow up with a rough scope and estimate. Again, &lt;strong&gt;don’t estimate on this call&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thank them for their time and let them know you will be in touch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is definitely a good starting point. Sometimes I will copy and paste these flows into a new document and tailor them based on the client that I am about to speak to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales is something that I am constantly working on and refining. I hope to continue to share my findings with you as I learn along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Goals For 2015</title>
      <link>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2014/12/29/goals-2015/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2014 01:00:00 -0600</pubDate>
      <author>brandontreb@gmail.com (|ZeroCool|)</author><guid>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2014/12/29/goals-2015/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It cannot be overstated that writing down one’s goals is critical to acheiving them. Pair that with sharing them with others who might help keep you accountable and your probabilty of achieving those goals goes way up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, I have decided to share my 2015 goals here on my blog in hopes that I will do a better job of acheiving them in the new year. I tried to focus on more measurable goals rather than things like “eat better” and “exercise more”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here they are in no particular order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professional&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a business plan&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grow &lt;a href=&#34;http://pixegon.com&#34;&gt;Pixegon&lt;/a&gt; (my mobile consultancy) to 2x 2014 revenue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hire a “director” to help with oversight of current developers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Move to a weekly rate instead of hourly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be consistent with morning routine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wake up early, pray, blog, mediate, read Bible, write down &lt;a href=&#34;http://zenhabits.net/purpose-your-day-most-important-task/&#34;&gt;MITs&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blog twice a month&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grow the blog’s mailing list&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take off / reduce workload on Friday’s to spend the day with my family&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Launch &lt;a href=&#34;http://alpha.autumnv.com&#34;&gt;Autumn Village&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give away more than 10% of personal income&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This list is definitely not complete, however it’s a good start. I hope to refine it over the coming months and more importantly, stick with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are your 2015 goals? I would love to hear about them in the comments or &lt;a href=&#34;mailto://brandon@brandontreb.com&#34;&gt;via email&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/share&#34;&gt;Tweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Software Development Consulting: Some Tips On Structuring Your Contracts</title>
      <link>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2014/03/31/software-development-consulting-contract-tips/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 31 Mar 2014 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate>
      <author>brandontreb@gmail.com (|ZeroCool|)</author><guid>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2014/03/31/software-development-consulting-contract-tips/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I first started out as an independent software developer, one of things that stressed me out the most was how to structure contracts that I sent to clients.  Working for a consultancy in my previous work-life I had seen contracts before, however, I never really paid enough attention to them to know what type of content went into them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After quite a bit of research, I found an invaluable resource.  Over at &lt;a href=&#34;http://techrepublic.com&#34;&gt;techrepublic.com&lt;/a&gt;, Chip Camden posted a beautifully crafted consulting contract template.  You can see the post and download the template &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/it-consultant/customizable-it-consultant-sample-contract/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  This post was a lifesaver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chip goes over EVERY single section of the contract and gives an explanation of why it’s there.  You can download the template and determine which sections you need for your business, based on his explanations.  It doesn’t get much easier than that.  Of course, I would still strongly suggest you fork over a couple hundred bucks and have a lawyer look over the contract before sending it off to clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;how-to-sign-contracts-online&#34;&gt;How To Sign Contracts Online&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have your contract in place, you will need a way to get your clients to sign it.  You could go the old-fashioned way of scanning, both parties signing, and scanning again OR you could use an online signature service.  One that I use and highly recommend is &lt;a href=&#34;https://rightsignature.com&#34;&gt;RightSignature&lt;/a&gt;. I know those guys personally and have had a great experience with the service so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;here-is-my-process&#34;&gt;Here is my process:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what I have found works out well for my business.  #proTip: I have my assistant do this now 😉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complete the contract blanks in regards to rates or any other information you want the client to see before they sign the contract.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upload the contract template to Google Drive (optional).  Make sure your company info is completed and all of the other fields (dates, signatures, etc…) are blanked out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once inside of your RightSignature account, you can connect to your Google Drive and import the document in.  You can also upload them directly from your computer if you don’t want to use Google Drive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RightSignature lets you put text fields and date boxes in the blanks and specify who is responsible for filling them out (you or the client).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, add the signature fields at the bottom and send off the document for signing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once every party has filled out the needed information, the completed document is then sent to both parties via email.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;other-considerations&#34;&gt;Other Considerations&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often times, the client will have their own contracts for you to sign.  This isn’t necessarily a bad thing.  However, make sure that you read over it carefully and run it by your lawyer.  Don’t try to force your contract on a client that already has their own.  They will usually not be open to this, in my experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure to have an ‘exit clause’ in your contract in case things go sour.  I seldom enter into fixed bid contracts so I usually have a clause where either party can cancel the contract with 7 days written notice.  This also makes the client feel at ease as they are not trapped with you in an event where their situation changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, be willing to be flexible.  Sometimes clients might not like certain clauses in your contract.  Be willing to change things like delivery dates, invoice dates, invoice periods, rates, etc… on a client to client basis.  Obviously, use your best judgement here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that you have found this post useful and it saves you some time hunting down a contract template.  I am always open to suggestions so if you see anything else that works for you, I would love to hear about it via email or in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please consider &lt;a href=&#34;http://eepurl.com/QAAhf&#34;&gt;signing up for my email list&lt;/a&gt; to get killer posts like this one delivered to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer and do not claim to be giving any real legal advice.  I am simply stating how I do things with my business.  Make sure to consult with a lawyer before engaging in any contracts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Being An Indie Software Developer And Signing NDAs</title>
      <link>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2014/02/28/indie-software-developer-signing-ndas/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2014 01:00:00 -0600</pubDate>
      <author>brandontreb@gmail.com (|ZeroCool|)</author><guid>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2014/02/28/indie-software-developer-signing-ndas/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Very frequently, I receive emails that go something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hey Brandon, I have a killer project idea. Do you want to work on it?  Please sign the NDA so we can talk.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early on when I first started consulting, I would have responded with something like “Sure send it over!” and signed the thing without hesitation.  As of late, I have changed my view on NDAs; at least in this type of situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those that don’t know, an NDA (non disclosure agreement) is a contract that is intended to protect the intellectual property of the client.  They make a lot of sense, especially in the event that the deal goes sour.  Say a client has some great idea for how to better take selfies that is going to revolutionize the selfie game.  If he doesn’t get a developer to sign an NDA, the developer could potentially be free to discuss the idea with others, leaving the idea open to be stolen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-i-dont-sign-preliminary-ndas&#34;&gt;Why I Don’t Sign Preliminary NDAs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the scenario I mentioned above, it would be very unwise of me to sign this NDA as I don’t have enough information about the product.  This puts me as a consultant at a huge risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say for example I am working on a photo/video sharing app (I get roughly 1 request a week for some spin on Instagram). Now, say the incoming project is some variant on photo sharing. If I sign the NDA, it now now puts me in a conflict of interest with my existing project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if I knew that the project was a photo/video sharing application up front, I still would not sign the NDA.  Much of the time (as mentioned above) clients want &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; similar applications.  If I went around signing every single NDA that came across our desks, I would be out of business after the first client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;when-i-will-sign-ndas&#34;&gt;When I Will Sign NDAs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the first thing that I do is ask for clarification on the project and tell them my NDA policy.  I basically tell them that I am happy to sign the NDA if one of the following conditions are met:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is extremely proprietary information (you can’t land a big enterprise contract without first signing an NDA)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are ready for project kickoff and all parties are aware of any potential conflicts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to that, if I am currently working on a project that is of similar type, it would be worthwhile to disclose that information to the potential new client (not the proprietary info, just that there is some overlap) so that they can choose whether or not to proceed.  Better to possibly lose the new client than end up in a crazy legal battle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the new client refuses to give you any more information, then they are not worth your time.  They will most likely be too challenging to work with down the road anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ndas-are-not-set-in-stone&#34;&gt;NDAs Are Not Set In Stone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you do finally decide to sign the NDA, know that it is not complete until you sign it. If you see something that you don’t like or want to add any additional clauses, feel free to propose those to the client.  Most clients will be very understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, it’s VERY IMPORTANT that you read all the way through an NDA and possibly run it by your lawyer before signing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;suggestion-if-you-want-your-nda-signed&#34;&gt;Suggestion If You Want Your NDA Signed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want a developer to sign your NDA, make sure to give him enough information about your project for him to make an educated decision.  If you just say “I want a photo sharing app” and expect an NDA signed, good luck.  Make sure that they know there is proprietary information involved and that you are doing something different that must be kept private.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An NDA is not required if you want to make say an “Instagram Clone For Puppies” or a “Miley Cyrus Flappy Bird Clone”.  Be sensitive to the uniqueness of your idea and decide if it really warrants an NDA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also note that developers are not out to steal your idea.  They get pitched hundreds of ideas and most of the time your idea falls into 3 categories anyway:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It’s not unique&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a technical challenge and that’s why it hasn’t been done (I get pitched a lot of ‘Map a grocery store so that my list will navigate me around’ ideas)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your idea is so niche and so unique that the general audience won’t get it and it won’t be profitable anyway&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not saying that every idea falls into these categories. But a good majority do. Most of them fall under #1 and that’s not necessarily a bad thing.  Google fell into #1 and look where they are today.  Just keep these things in mind when requiring a signed NDAs before you will give out any info.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has been quite a bit of discussion lately (especially on Hacker News) about whether or not to sign NDAs.  Most of the recent articles I have read are simply titled “I Will Not Sign Your NDA”.  I feel that NDAs have there place, but you should sign them only with extreme caution.  Examine each NDA on a case by case basis and determine how it will affect your business in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer and do not claim to be giving any real legal advice.  I am simply stating how I do things.  Make sure to consult with a lawyer before engaging in any contracts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Becoming A Software Consultant: My Backstory</title>
      <link>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2014/01/31/becoming-software-consultant-backstory/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 31 Jan 2014 01:00:00 -0600</pubDate>
      <author>brandontreb@gmail.com (|ZeroCool|)</author><guid>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2014/01/31/becoming-software-consultant-backstory/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently published a post about &lt;a href=&#34;http://brandontreb.com/learned-first-year-ios-consulting&#34;&gt;my first year of being an independent iPhone development consultant&lt;/a&gt;.  The feedback from my readers was incredible, however there was one important thread on Hacker News that I wanted to address.  The issues were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my common hangups with these kind of posts is the lack of history as to what lead people to these consulting gigs. Where were you before, and how long were you there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found this to be a very valid point.  Far too often you see guys posting their end of the year profits from their consulting gigs and they make it sound extremely easy.  This can be dangerous as joe n00b might be so inspired that he quits his job and jumps right into the deep end without first preparing himself and assessing the risks involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, I wanted to write a bit about my backstory and how it ultimately lead to my ability to strike it out on my own as a consultant.  I have read stories similar to mine and there are a few key points that seem to be common, which I will highlight as I go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Circa Summer 2008 – Just Before Apple Releases The iPhone (not iOS) SDK **&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2008, I was preparing to enter my senior year of college for Computer Science at UNM.  A quick note about CS in New Mexico.  There are TONS of government contractors (Sandia, Ultramain, Honeywell, Lockheed, etc.) in NM and college CS courses seem very much tailored to preparing students to head down this road towards one of these contractors.  This is where most of my buddies from college ultimately ended up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, like any good UNM CS student, I got a job at Intel hacking C# tools for their engineers to use during testing.  It was fine, but I knew I could not work in a cube forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around that time, one of my buddies had the original iPhone and I was crazy jealous.  I think I had some silly Windows CE brick or a Palm Treo or something.  It was obvious that the iPhone was the “next big thing” and I took notice.  So I started developing web apps for the iPhone, as that was the primary way to get custom apps for the devices.  Apple even had a terrible (non mobile formatted) interface for exploring such web apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I built &lt;em&gt;cool&lt;/em&gt; things like a Weight Watchers Point Calculator (my wife’s idea) and Minesweeper and to my surprise made a couple bucks a day on ads.  This really fueled my excitement.  Then, Apple announced the official SDK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**An Aventure In iCodeBlog And Other NDA Violations **&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Apple first released the SDK, the App Store didn’t exist yet.  All developers were forced under Apple’s NDA, stating that we weren’t able to discuss any aspect of the SDK on the web.  As you can imagine, this left very little resources available for learning how to actually do development.  There were no blogs, no books, and the only source of information was Apple’s documentation.  I saw this as a HUGE opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I very quickly registered the domain &lt;a href=&#34;http://icodeblog.com&#34;&gt;icodeblog.com&lt;/a&gt; and setup WordPress.  This led to my very &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.icodeblog.com/2008/07/22/icodeblog-launched/&#34;&gt;first post&lt;/a&gt; in July of 2008. I had no idea what I was doing; it was my first blog ever, but I knew I would be able to learn more effectively if I was teaching others as I went along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a Java developer, I was comfortable reading documentation so I dug right in to the iOS docs.  I spent all of my free time (the time that wasn’t spent with my wife) learning and blogging.  I was violating the NDA by discussing it on the web, but my page views were growing every day.  Other blogs started to sprout up but I soon had the most popular iOS development blog on the web.  I had over 10K RSS subscribers one month after my blog launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things were really exciting, however, I had to start thinking about my future and how I was going to support my family.  Still being a bit narrow-minded with my career choices, I applied for a job at Lockheed Martin and got a position.  It was all set; I would graduate college in the spring and head to the “cube farm”.  Destined for a life of “here’s your input, give me this output”, TPS Reports, and other corporate stereotype jokes…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s when I got my first iOS programming job offer…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enter RightSprite&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can imagine, the popularity of iCodeBlog did not go unnoticed.  I received job inquiries quite often and one them happened to be from a guy who lived in Ireland named Jonathan.  He was a wealthy American entrepreneur who had added a mobile offering to his already successful rails consultancy called RightSprite.  However, he started his business by outsourcing to the Ukraine, which yielded fairly poor results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in the winter of 2008 I received an email that they wanted to purchase iCodeBlog and give me a job replacing their outsourced team.  He also happened to have an employee in NM named Josh.  Josh and I met at a “hip” food place that I had never heard of and I was blown away that this was considered “business”.  Needless to say, I was excited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here I am, about to graduate with a perfect job lined up, and I get an offer like this.  I had no idea what to do.  The idea of working remote was foreign to me and had never even crossed my mind.  People can actually do that?  I can work in my pajamas??&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I decided to take a risk, sell him my blog, and accept the job offer.  I was terrified-especially when he told me that my first check was coming out of his personal bank account and that was why it was late.  Little did I know, this would be one of the best career decisions I could ever make…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Build, Hire, Repeat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I graduated from college and my career was in full swing.  I was the sole developer at a consultancy that had more mobile work than it knew what to do with.  My family had no idea what I did.  They though I was a drug dealer or something just as lucrative.  At one point, my grandma asked me, “When are you going to get a &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; job like your cousin Michael (he works for the city)”.  I could’t quite believe this was a legitimate job myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things started to get very exciting.  Jonathan asked me to help hire our next employee.  Luckily, a guy by the name of Collin reached out to me and asked if he could guest blog on iCodeBlog.  A few tutorials later and we offered him a job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RightsSprite continued to scale up and I helped hire quite a few new developers.  They eventually moved to a physical building in Portland, Oregon while I still worked remotely from NM.  The team continued to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Book Deal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though I didn’t own iCodeBlog anymore, I still contributed to it from time to time.  This lead to me being contacted by a few publishing companies with book offers.  A book offer?  It doesn’t sound that cool now, but in 2009, when there weren’t many iOS development books, it sounded incredible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to go with Manning Publishing and I updated their iPhone development book from web app-centric to SDK-centric.  It amazed me that I struggled to write four paragraph essays in high school but I was now writing a four hundred page book with ease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book did fairly well and sold around 10,000 copies.  Unfortunately, when you are an author of a tech book, that amounts to just about nothing in profit.  As you can imagine, I had little motivation to do the update the next year when Apple updated the SDK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A New Sheriff In Town&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after moving the offices to Portland, the owner sold the company and we had a new president and CEO.  He ran things a bit differently but ultimately things were cruising forward.  Our team continued to expand and eventually I hired our first Android developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December of 2011, I was promoted to the Director of Mobile Engineering.  It was a fancy title and I was entirely proud to hand out business cards with that printed on them.  I had helped build the team up to around sixteen mobile developers and it was now my job to manage them, as well as work closely with sales to land larger contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2012 was a great year of working on cool projects including the Food Network and Google Fiber TV.  I got to attend WWDC and spend a few weeks on Google’s campuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things Get Shaken Up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little did I know, there was some unrest in the company with the higher-up managers.  One day, there was a company memo that the three people who were higher ranked than myself had all left.  There were rumors as to why they left, but no one really had the true story.  This caused a stir in the company and a few more developers began to follow suit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, of course, led to some company restructuring which put me right at the top with one other team member.  I was now one of the highest paid people in the company and solely in charge of the entire mobile team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought everything was perfect until one day in December of 2012, I received the following message when I logged into Gmail:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your account has been suspended, please contact the administrator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This made me considerably suspicious.  I knew there was a lot of restructuring in the recent history and I immediately wondered if I was next on the chopping block.  I was logged into Linked In at the time and noticed the company owner was the last person to view my profile.  “He suspects me of looking for other jobs and is checking up on me”, I thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s when I received a message on Skype from him.  It said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brandon, do you have time to talk?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My heart jumped into my throat.  I knew what was coming next.  He was soon up on video chat and proceeded to tell me that the company was undergoing some restructuring and my position has been eliminated.  “Eliminated?” I thought.  And then I asked him what that meant for me.  He repeated the sentence again, said thanks, and hung up.  That was it; I no longer had a job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My “secure” job that I had been working at for four years disappeared in a matter of seconds with very little “real” explanation.  I was speechless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taking The Plunge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After getting “let go”, I took the rest of the day off and went out with my family (wife and two kids).  We were shocked, but I knew what I had to do.  It was what I had been dreaming of doing for quite some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Armed with the knowledge of the entire software pipeline-from sales, to development, to maintenance-I hit the ground running the very next day in search of my first contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote &lt;a href=&#34;http://brandontreb.com/what-i-learned-in-my-first-month-being-a-contract-ios-developer&#34;&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt; documenting that very first month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Takeaway&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been a little over a year since I’ve had a “secure” job.  I put that word in quotes because I now believe the only way to have a secure career is to make one for yourself.  You could be let go at any time, for any reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was very fortunate to have a first job that allowed me to learn the needed skills to do what I’m passionate about; building consumer facing apps that get used by thousands of people.  If you want to do the same, I would encourage you to find a job that lets you explore all of the aspects of consulting to find out if it’s right for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I wonder why everyone is not a consultant.  It feels so free to be able to hack outside on a nice day or go sailing with my buddies on a random Wednesday.  But that’s just one side of the coin.  Other days, I wonder why I am even doing it.  I often wish I had a simple job with a well-defined task where once I got “off work”, I could go home and not think about it again until the next day but I don’t have that luxury.  There are real risks and stresses involved with working for yourself so I urge you to weigh them out before taking the plunge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have received so many good questions through my last few posts about consulting.  They have inspired me and I intend on taking this year to diligently blog about topics such as finding clients, health insurance, contracts, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So please share and subscribe; I hope to help you on your journey to becoming free of your corporate chains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post is part of a series about becoming and independent software consultant.  I am participating in this series with my good friend Josh. &lt;a href=&#34;http://joshuastephenson.com/2014/02/06/on-becoming-an-independent-software-consultant/&#34;&gt;You can read his take on this post here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What I Learned In My First Year Of iOS Consulting</title>
      <link>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2014/01/01/learned-first-year-ios-consulting/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2014 01:00:00 -0600</pubDate>
      <author>brandontreb@gmail.com (|ZeroCool|)</author><guid>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2014/01/01/learned-first-year-ios-consulting/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wow, I can’t believe it has already been a full year since I struck it out on my own.  Last year, I &lt;a href=&#34;http://brandontreb.com/what-i-learned-in-my-first-month-being-a-contract-ios-developer&#34;&gt;published a post&lt;/a&gt; after my first month on doing contract iOS development.  Needless to say, I have grown and learned quite a bit over the past year and I wanted to share some of those experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;income&#34;&gt;Income&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I won’t share exact numbers, I left my 6 figure/year job to pursue the indie/consulting life.  During the course of the year, I was able to amass 40% more income in 2013 than I had at my previous position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to that, I had the time to launch a couple iOS applications and thus upping my Apple income by about 20% this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;network-network-network&#34;&gt;Network Network Network&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would say spending time networking and meeting people is just as important as being able to write code if you want to be successful on your own.  Through out the year, I dedicated at least five to ten hours a week just meeting with people, talking on the phone, and making new connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often times, I would get contract opportunities that I knew for sure that I wasn’t going to take; either because I didn’t love the project, or (more often than not) because I didn’t have the bandwidth to take them on.  However, rather than just writing the client back “&lt;em&gt;I don’t have time&lt;/em&gt;“, I would take the call (or meeting in town), make the connection, and even listen to details about the contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My wife would tell me to stop wasting my time and that those hours would be better spent on project work that actually made money.  However, these contacts are arguably &lt;strong&gt;more&lt;/strong&gt; valuable than the hours “lost”.  In many situations, I have reached out to those potential clients weeks or months later once I hired a new developer and was then able signed a contract.  If I had declined the meeting to begin with, they probably wouldn’t have been as inclined to work with me so readily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;subcontractors&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subcontractors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subcontracting has been a mixed bag for me.  It seems to be the only (safe-ish) way to expand your business as a consultant, other than hiring full time developers.  So, if you want to be able to work less yourself (which is almost never the case) or increase your companies revenue, you need to hire out.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I found the right people, subcontracting was a dream.  I was able to reach more clients, still deliver the same value in the work, and achieve the client’s goals, all while expanding my business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main challenge I have had is deciding whether to hire subcontractors from here in the states or “offshore”.  They both have their benefits and complications. Here are some I have found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits of hiring in the states:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communication – Most of the time their timezones are close enough that one of you is not inconvenienced to communicate in real time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trust From Clients – Some clients still have some issues with “offshore”, especially because many of them have tried their hand at the ODesk lottery and have lost.  So, saying you have US based team members sometimes makes them more comfortable. It’s unfortunate, but I have seen it to be true in some cases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Colleagues – Often times you already know or have worked with these guys since starting with acquaintances/friends is a good place to look for developers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complications hiring in the states&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cost – US devs are expensive.  Most of the time they have full time jobs and want to do consulting on the side.  So it is important that they get paid more to do contract work than their day job pays.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Colleagues – This is on the negative list as well because hiring people you know can get weird if things go awry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Benefit of Offshore developers **&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cost – I put this here, however that doesn’t mean I hire “cheap” developers.  Honestly, if you are not paying a contractor well, you are either under paying him and should give him a raise OR he shouldn’t be working for you as he’s probably too junior.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perspective – I have some incredible developers in other countries that have taught me quite a bit whether it’s about development, process, culture, or even my own code.  It’s a great opportunity to learn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Problems with Offshore developers **&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Location – Timezone issues &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be a problem if you let them.  For example, I have a developer who lives in a completely different timezone than my own.  However, he does a fantastic job of being available when he is needed.  I have had other instances where it was very challenging to reach my developer in an event where I needed information on short notice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vetting Process – Finding developers is a little more tricky.  With devs in the states, you can just head to a local meet up or conference, but finding GOOD “offshore” devs is a little trickier.  I have lucked out a few times, but for the most part it’s a bit more work.  I would suggest spending a little of your own money to adequately search and vet each candidate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Language – While doing iOS development, you may need your client and your developer to communicate with one another.  That being said, it’s vital to find a developer who &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; can understand and who can understand you in order to make communication possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;hiring-an-assistant&#34;&gt;Hiring An Assistant&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking a page from Tim Ferris’ &lt;em&gt;4 Hour Work Week&lt;/em&gt;, I decided to hire an assistant.  Ferris suggests “virtual”, however, I have hired one locally (she’ll be proofreading this post 😉 ).  I think it’s one of the best decisions I have made as a business owner.  Here is just a short list of things she handles for me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contracts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invoicing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Payments of contractors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phone calls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personal issues (like returns, purchasing equipment, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if she saves me two hours per week, she has paid for herself, and believe me, she saves me much more than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;never-decline-a-contract&#34;&gt;Never Decline A Contract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mentioned this earlier in the post, but I want to reiterate it here.  I seldom tell clients “no” and I really feel that it has worked out to my benefit.  At the very least, I hear them out and add them as a contact to keep in mind for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I generally do when I can’t take on a client is I will give them an estimate of when myself or a member of my team will be available.  That way, if they are okay with the timeline, I can keep the pipeline open.  If not, there is no harm done.  Also, if I hire another developer before the time I said I was available, sometimes the client will still have the need and I am able to fill it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I absolutely don’t have time or don’t want a particular contract, I will refer the client out to other dev shops.  I don’t look at this as competition, but rather opportunity as I would hope they would do the same for me one day.  As an added bonus, some of them have a referral fee so you can at least profit from pairing the client up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;taxes&#34;&gt;Taxes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have found out that taxes are less fun when you are self-employed than when you are employed by a business.  Luckily my wife is MUCH better at money management than I am, so she set up a separate tax account where roughly 40% of our income would go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the other good decisions I made besides hiring an assistant was hiring a CPA.  She has saved me countless hours and fees and is worth her weight in gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hire a CPA from day one; you will never regret it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;family&#34;&gt;Family&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know this is a “business” related post, but I have to mention this.  Having a wife and kids, I am very much a family man.  Working for myself has been such a blessing since I have been able to spend considerably more time with my family than when I was employed by someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if it’s a nice summer day and the family decides to head to the zoo, I can just go without asking a boss for time off or taking PTO.  I simply work in the evening or more hours the next day to recoup the time.  Personal time management is key to be able to have this kind of freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, 2013 was an incredible year.  While I did make mistakes (a ton), I gained so much knowledge and had a blast doing so.  Going solo isn’t for everyone (some days I wonder why everyone** isn’t** doing it, and others I wonder why I &lt;strong&gt;am&lt;/strong&gt;), but it’s been one of the most exciting experiences of my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look forward to what 2014 brings and seeing how I can continue to grow my consultancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy New Year and Happy Hacking!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Back To My Roots</title>
      <link>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2013/06/12/back-to-my-roots/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 12 Jun 2013 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate>
      <author>brandontreb@gmail.com (|ZeroCool|)</author><guid>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2013/06/12/back-to-my-roots/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote my very first blog post back in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.icodeblog.com/2008/07/22/icodeblog-launched/&#34;&gt;July of 2008&lt;/a&gt; when I start &lt;a href=&#34;http://iCodeBlog.com&#34;&gt;iCodeBlog.com&lt;/a&gt;.  I started the blog because I saw a huge need for iOS development tutorials on the web and really wanted to help others as I progressed in my development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, quite a bit has changed since then.  I have written books, spoken at conferences, and built and shipped over 40 iOS applications.  Since selling iCodeblog in 2009, I have really let my passion for blogging fizzle.  For the first 2 years of the iCode sale, I wasn’t allowed to write tutorials on any other site.  This was very discouraging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, I have guest blogged iOS tutorials on several sites including &lt;a href=&#34;http://mobile.tutsplus.com/author/brandon-trebitowski/&#34;&gt;mobile.tutsplus.com&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.raywenderlich.com/author/brandontreb&#34;&gt;raywenderlich.com&lt;/a&gt;.  This has been pretty hit or miss for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of recent, I have become an &lt;a href=&#34;http://brandontreb.com/what-i-learned-in-my-first-month-being-a-contract-ios-developer&#34;&gt;independent iOS developer&lt;/a&gt; and have been solving quite a few hard problems and coming up with some interesting solutions on projects that I have been a part of.  I now want to share some of those solutions with the iOS community in the form of tutorial blog posts.  These come in all shapes in sizes from cool UIKit hacks to building simple backend services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, when I say that I want to “get back to my roots”, I really want to start consistently blogging again and educating other developers using the knowledge I have gained over the years.  So stick around, &lt;a href=&#34;http://brandontreb.com/feed&#34;&gt;subscribe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/brandontreb&#34;&gt;follow me&lt;/a&gt;, and please don’t hesitate to suggest tutorial ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy hacking…&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What&amp;#8217;s Your Cruising Speed?</title>
      <link>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2011/10/05/whats-your-cruising-speed/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 05 Oct 2011 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate>
      <author>brandontreb@gmail.com (|ZeroCool|)</author><guid>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2011/10/05/whats-your-cruising-speed/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/uploads/2011/2009-porsche-911-carrera-19_460x0w.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, I launched an application called &lt;a href=&#34;http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/smart-lockscreen-creator/id419890996?mt=8&#34;&gt;Smart Lockscreen Creator&lt;/a&gt;. It was a pretty simple app that allowed you to add dynamic data (such as weather) to your wallpaper and save it back out to your camera roll. The idea is to improve the functionality of the user’s lockscreen. It did very well on launch (and even made it to #1 in the Israel App Store). At the peak, I was selling about 600 copies per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, the honeymoon period is over and sales have slowed down &lt;strong&gt;quite a bit&lt;/strong&gt;, however they have completely stabilized around what I’m calling the “cruising speed”. So, what’s my speed? On an average day, I will sell between 10-15 copies of the application per day. This is with no additional marketing, I’m not on any top 500 pages, and honestly I haven’t done much to the application at all. The app even has ~2 star rating. Not because it sucks, but because people don’t read the description and assume it will constantly update their lockscreen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have asked a few developers and this seems to be a fairly common cruising speed. So, now I’m asking you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s YOUR cruising speed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think updating the application will affect this speed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What dictates the speed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d love to hear your responses in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Join Me At The Voices That Matter iOS Conference</title>
      <link>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2011/09/07/join-me-at-the-voices-that-matter-ios-conference/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 07 Sep 2011 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate>
      <author>brandontreb@gmail.com (|ZeroCool|)</author><guid>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2011/09/07/join-me-at-the-voices-that-matter-ios-conference/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/uploads/2011/topright.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
In November, I will be attending the &lt;a href=&#34;http://ios2011.voicesthatmatter.com/&#34;&gt;Voices That Matter iOS Developers conference&lt;/a&gt;. It will be my third time attending, and I can’t recommend it enough. One major change from this year however is, I will be attending as a sponsor. A new company/project (currently in private alpha) will be participating as a sponsor at the conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We intend to have a table set up with multiple computers and devices so you can check out our product first hand. Bleh, that sounds kind of spammy. But, we have been working on something incredibly killer and I can’t wait to share it with all of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If YOU are planning on attending the conference&lt;/strong&gt;, please comment on this post, &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/brandontreb&#34;&gt;write me on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, or email me. I’d love to set up a one on one time to give you the full demo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I’m sure many of you already have a discount code, but if not, I have a pretty sweet promo code for $100!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;bstblog&#34;&gt;BSTBLOG&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter that at checkout. Combining that with the “Early Bird Pricing”, you save $300! Not a bad deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you do end up coming (you are crazy not to), please communicate with me. At least to say hi, you don’t &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to here my super awesome sales spiel if you don’t want to…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Coding!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>10 Great Pixel Art Tutorial And Free Resource Sites For Your Games</title>
      <link>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2011/08/14/10-great-pixel-art-tutorial-and-free-resource-sites-for-your-games/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 14 Aug 2011 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate>
      <author>brandontreb@gmail.com (|ZeroCool|)</author><guid>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2011/08/14/10-great-pixel-art-tutorial-and-free-resource-sites-for-your-games/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I don’t usually create “list” posts, however I wanted to share a grouping of resources I have been collecting over the past few months. As you may have noticed, I’m a bit of a Pixel Art fanatic and wanted to share with you the tutorials that helped to get me started as well as some sites offering some high quality &lt;strong&gt;free&lt;/strong&gt; pixel art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that some of these sites have similar content, however they all take a slightly different approach in teaching. I found it very helpful to read each of the tutorials and learn from different points of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;1-gas-13--isometric-pixel-art-tutorial&#34;&gt;1. Gas 13 – Isometric Pixel Art Tutorial&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/uploads/2011/f9.gif&#34; alt=&#34;Pixel House&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gas13.ru/v3/tutorials/isometric_pixelart_tutorial_mathematics_of_isometrics.php&#34;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my very first pixel art tutorial. I was amazed at how quickly I was able to make a really professional looking pixel art building. I highly recommend all of the tutorials on this guy’s site. Some of them however can be quite complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;2-derek-yu--the-pixel-tutorial&#34;&gt;2. Derek Yu – The Pixel Tutorial&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/uploads/2011/lucha-finished.gif&#34; alt=&#34;Wrestler&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.derekyu.com/?page_id=221&#34;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was another site that I stumbled upon early on in my pixel art quest. Derek provides a nice story telling approach to teaching the in’s and out’s of pixel art. I really appreciated his tutorial on lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;3-mini-wizard-studios--what-is-isometric-pixel-art&#34;&gt;3. Mini Wizard Studios – What is ‘Isometric’ pixel art&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/uploads/2011/office.gif&#34; alt=&#34;Sample pixel art&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.miniwizardstudios.com/iso.asp&#34;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This guy offers another dead simple intro to pixel art. Most of it is just explanation, however his examples are quite good. He shows examples of Backgrounds, Characters, objects, tiles, as well as a ton of different UI elements and icons. It’s a great place to go for some inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;4-hub-pages--how-to-start-with-pixel-art&#34;&gt;4. Hub Pages – How To Start With Pixel Art&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/uploads/2011/1629662_f520.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Victorian House&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://vanmall.hubpages.com/hub/How-To-Start-With-Pixel-Art&#34;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, another great site for the pixel art n00b. This tutorial goes over all of the basics of line, cubes, and texturing. It also links out to other great pixel art tutorials for creating various objects such as a bed, table, and lamp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;5-bio-rust--isometric-pixel-art&#34;&gt;5. Bio Rust – Isometric Pixel Art&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/uploads/2011/Image-15a.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Pixel Sphere&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.biorust.com/tutorials/detail/247/us/&#34;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial is a bit rushed &lt;em&gt;however&lt;/em&gt; it provides a great overview for creating other basic shapes besides a cube. In addition to lines and cubes, it demonstrates pyramids, cylinders, and spheres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;6-oceans-dream--pixel-art-tutorials&#34;&gt;6. Oceans Dream – Pixel Art Tutorials&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/uploads/2011/celsiusHair.png&#34; alt=&#34;Pixel Character&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://pixel.oceansdream.net/&#34;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the most comprehensive site for pixel art tutorials. While many of them aren’t for the faint of heart, there is some fantastic content here. This site has everything from tips and tricks, to character creation, to breakdowns of existing games. I could spend hours on this site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;7-pixel-character-tutorial--nekosorayagami-on-deviant-art&#34;&gt;7. Pixel Character Tutorial – NekoSoraYagami on Deviant Art&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/uploads/2011/Screen%20shot%202011-08-13%20at%209.38.11%20PM.png&#34; alt=&#34;Pixel Character&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://nekosorayagami.deviantart.com/art/Pixel-Character-Tutorial-76829227&#34;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a nice in depth tutorial for creating a custom character from start to finish. They start out with a base character (plain, nude, genderless) and turn it into their own creation. Very well written and very fun to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;8-city-creator&#34;&gt;8. City Creator&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/uploads/2011/home_card_1.gif&#34; alt=&#34;City Creator&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.citycreator.com/&#34;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The City creator is not so much a tutorial as it is a resource for creating gorgeous pixel cities. It has a nice interface and a &lt;strong&gt;huge&lt;/strong&gt; selection of buildings, objects, roads, signs, and trees to go into your city. I am not sure what their license is on the generated cities, however I didn’t see any clause about not reusing the graphics in your own projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;9-has-graphics&#34;&gt;9. Has Graphics&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/uploads/2011/genetica-texture-pack-10-mystery-forest.png&#34; alt=&#34;Pixel level&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://hasgraphics.com/&#34;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Has graphics provides tons of free game graphics mostly geared towards tiled games. So, if you are hacking an old school RPG or platformer, I would definitely check out this site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;10-vx-resource-planet&#34;&gt;10. VX Resource Planet&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/uploads/2011/remakertp01.png?w=384&amp;amp;h=384&#34; alt=&#34;Pixel characters&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://vxresource.wordpress.com/&#34;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the &lt;strong&gt;Motherload&lt;/strong&gt;. I have saved the best for last. This a wordpress blog that contains TONS of free pixel art and tilesets for use in your games. They have endless spritesheets and beautiful tiles that would enable anyone to have a very professional looking game. If you visit one site from this list, visit this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any resources of your own, please paste them in the comments. My readers and myself would be very interested in them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Coding!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cocos2D Tutorial &amp;#8211; Dynamically Coloring Sprites</title>
      <link>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2011/07/30/cocos2d-tutorial-dynamically-coloring-sprites/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 30 Jul 2011 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate>
      <author>brandontreb@gmail.com (|ZeroCool|)</author><guid>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2011/07/30/cocos2d-tutorial-dynamically-coloring-sprites/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/uploads/2011/Screen%20shot%202011-07-30%20at%204.39.28%20PM.png&#34; alt=&#34;Custom Bitizens&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever seen a game (such as Tiny Tower) that contains similar sprites that only vary by certain attributes (coloring, shading, accessories, etc…)? I would often wonder how long it would take the artists to create each permutation of these sprites. After discovering that you can call a method on a CCSprite called setColor, I realized how most of this customization is done in code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial will be a continuation of my last post about &lt;a href=&#34;http://brandontreb.com/Pixel-Art-Character-Tutorial-Create-A-Bitizen&#34;&gt;creating your own Bitizen in Photoshop&lt;/a&gt;. So, if you don’t already have a Bitizen character to work with, I suggest you follow that tutorial OR download my template &lt;a href=&#34;http://cl.ly/2u3h0g2F2H2b1S280519/bitizen.psd&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;white-out&#34;&gt;White Out&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned above, we are going to be using the setColor method of CCSprite to dynamically color each part of our Bitizen. The way it works is each pixel’s color is multiplied by the value passed into setColor giving it a “tint”. So, pixels that are all white will be fully tinted and pixels that are all black will have no change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, our first goal is to create an “all white” version of our Bitizen. Don’t worry about shading for now, I will cover that in a moment. I just started with our Bitizen as a base and created new layers for each of the “white” components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should end up with 5 new layers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;white-head&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;white-skin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;white-hair&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;white-pants&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;white-shoes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each layer, trace over the corresponding colored layer. For the “white-skin” layer, make sure to trace over the hands as well as the face. This will ensure that your Bitizen’s color is consistent. When you are done, your Bitizen should look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/uploads/2011/Screen%20shot%202011-07-30%20at%204.52.03%20PM.png&#34; alt=&#34;White Bitizen&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looks pretty bland… The next step is to add our shading. We will be using only black with varying alpha in order to achieve the desired shading. So, make sure to play with it a bit and get the shading to your liking. Add a new shading layer for each component (or simply draw on top of the current layer with the black pencil).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your bitizen should look something like this after doing all of the shading:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/uploads/2011/Screen%20shot%202011-07-30%20at%203.47.09%20PM.png&#34; alt=&#34;Shaded Bitzen&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;chop-it-up&#34;&gt;Chop It Up&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final thing we need to do with our graphic is chop up the pieces so that they can be individually colored. Convert each of the white-* layers to Smart Objects, copy them to a new document, and save them. You should end up with 5 .png files (head.png,skin.png,hair.png,pants.png,shoes.png).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I increased the size of my Bitizen by 4 before doing this step. You might consider increasing their size as well. Remember that the size increase you choose will change some of the values when we recreate the Bitizen in Cocos2D. So, if you want to follow along, make sure your Bitizen is 60×100 before exporting the various parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing to note is we are going to bring these into Cocos2D as 5 different sprites. There are some optimizations that you could do using sprite sheets, however I want to make things as clear as possible. So, we are going the long way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://cl.ly/1I102a1F2L323C1R2Y2h&#34;&gt;You can download my completed white bitizen here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;rebuilding-the-bitizen-in-cocos2d&#34;&gt;Rebuilding The Bitizen In Cocos2D&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have imported the 5 Bitizen image files into Cocos2D, you need to reconstruct them in code. This involves adding each sprite to the layer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the code to display the skin/head+hands in our layer. As a note, I simply created a new Cocos2D project and am using the retina only mode for my display using [director enableRetinaDisplay:YES]. The offsets will change quite a bit if you are choosing to support non-retina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;code class=’objc’&amp;gt;int spriteX = 240;
int spriteY = 160;
CCSprite \*skin = [CCSprite spriteWithFile:@“skin.png”];
[skin setPosition:ccp(spriteX, spriteY)];
[self addChild:skin];&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will draw our white(shaded) head on the screen. That’s pretty boring so let’s draw the rest of the body. Update your code to look like the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;code class=’objc’&amp;gt;int spriteX = 240;
int spriteY = 160;
CCSprite \*skin = [CCSprite spriteWithFile:@“skin.png”];
[skin setPosition:ccp(spriteX, spriteY)];
[self addChild:skin];


int hairOffset = 11;


CCSprite \*hair = [CCSprite spriteWithFile:@“hair.png”];
[hair setPosition:ccp(spriteX, spriteY+hairOffset)];
[self addChild:hair];


int shirtYOffset = -9;
int shirtXOffset = 1;


CCSprite \*shirt = [CCSprite spriteWithFile:@“shirt.png”];
[shirt setPosition:ccp(spriteX + shirtXOffset, spriteY+shirtYOffset)];
[self addChild:shirt];


int pantsYOffset = -15;
int pantsXOffset = 1;


CCSprite \*pants = [CCSprite spriteWithFile:@“pants.png”];
[pants setPosition:ccp(spriteX + pantsXOffset, spriteY+pantsYOffset)];
[self addChild:pants];


int shoesYOffset = -17;
int shoesXOffset = 1;


CCSprite \*shoes = [CCSprite spriteWithFile:@“shoes.png”];
[shoes setPosition:ccp(spriteX + shoesXOffset, spriteY+shoesYOffset)];
[self addChild:shoes];&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, you should see the lonely ghost of a Bitizen standing in the center of your screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/uploads/2011/Screen%20shot%202011-07-30%20at%205.10.34%20PM.png&#34; alt=&#34;Ghost Bitizen&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still boring… Time to spice him up with some color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;tinting-cocos2d-sprites&#34;&gt;Tinting Cocos2D Sprites&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned before, tinting Cocos2D sprites is very simple. I would recommend keeping all sprites that you wish to tint a shade of white/gray otherwise some crazy things will happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The setColor method takes an array of integers from 0-255. This array contains 3 numbers (1st for red, 2nd for green, 3rd for blue). For example, we can pass all Red to the setColor method by sending it {255,0,0}.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s start by tinting our Bitizen’s shirt a random color. Change the code that displays the shirt to look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;code class=’objc’&amp;gt;CCSprite *shirt = [CCSprite spriteWithFile:@&amp;#34;shirt.png&amp;#34;];
[shirt setPosition:ccp(spriteX + shirtXOffset, spriteY+shirtYOffset)];
ccColor3B shirtColor = {arc4random() % 255,arc4random() % 255,arc4random() % 255};
[shirt setColor:shirtColor];
[self addChild:shirt];&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, every time you run the application, the Bitizen should have a different shirt color. You can apply this principle to each of your sprites to completely customize your Bitizen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if you only want to limit certain colors? (you ask). Well, that’s a great question. I solved this by creating an array of ccColor3Bs. Basically an array of arrays. And then I index into this array and set the color accordingly. Here is an example of setting a random skin color to avoid having blue people (unless maybe you are making Smurfs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;code class=’objc’&amp;gt;ccColor3B skinColors[] = { 
    {247,224,194},
    {255,232,214},
    {136,119,82},
    {245,232,205},
    {144,110,38}
};
CCSprite *skin = [CCSprite spriteWithFile:@&amp;#34;skin.png&amp;#34;];
[skin setPosition:ccp(spriteX, spriteY)];
ccColor3B skinColor = skinColors[arc4random() % 5];
[skin setColor:skinColor];
[self addChild:skin];&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have an array of 5 different arrays and randomly index into it using skinColors[arc4random() % 5]. This will give me a random color within my skin color group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After running this through a loop and adding random colors to some of the other sprites, I ended up creating the image you see at the top of this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that this tutorial has found you well and I have demystified the magic that is dynamic sprites. You may download the source code for this tutorial (include the code to generate the screenshot above) &lt;a href=&#34;http://cl.ly/3h3R2D1p2w2y2X3t0R32&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <author>brandontreb@gmail.com (|ZeroCool|)</author><guid>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2011/07/16/pixel-art-character-tutorial-creating-and-customizing-a-bitizen/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/uploads/2011/Toy-Story-brandontreb.com.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will be a continuation of my last pixel art tutorial about &lt;a href=&#34;http://brandontreb.com/Configuring-Photoshop-For-Pixel-Art&#34;&gt;configuring Photoshop for Pixel Art&lt;/a&gt;. For the past month or so, both my wife an I have been pretty addicted to this amazing game called &lt;a href=&#34;http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tiny-tower/id422667065?mt=8&#34;&gt;Tiny Tower&lt;/a&gt; created by &lt;a href=&#34;http://nimblebit.com/&#34;&gt;Nimble Bits&lt;/a&gt;. The biggest draw for me to this game isn’t the fact that it has great simulation style game mechanics, it’s the fact that it was created using &lt;strong&gt;Pixel Art&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned in my other post, I have a serious passion for pixel art and have been doing everything I can to learn about it and improve my skills. One great thing about it is, &lt;strong&gt;anyone can do it&lt;/strong&gt;. You don’t have to be this amazing artist to be able to create interesting pixel art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;getting-started&#34;&gt;Getting Started&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They say that imitation is the best form of flattery, so we are going to flatter the heck out of the Nimble Bits guys are learn how to make our own Bitizen characters from Tiny Tower. I have found that a good starting place for learning pixel art (or anything really), is to start with something that already exists, copy it, then modify it. Once you do that a few times and get comfortable, then you should have the confidence to branch out into creating your own artwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When creating a game (or complex piece of pixel artwork) that involves a ton of different characters, it will save a ton of time and energy if you create a “base character”. What I mean by “base character” is one that is very bland and plain. Something that is easily customizable. So, that’s what this tutorial is about, we are going to create a bland white guy for Tiny Tower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I want to point out before we start is, I have lowered the resolution of the character a bit and am not putting in as much detail as the Nimble Bits team. This is just for simplicity’s sake in order to get my point across and make things easier on you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;new-document&#34;&gt;New Document&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start out by creating a 15x25px document. I know, it’s very small, but we don’t need much. Make sure you have Photoshop &lt;a href=&#34;http://brandontreb.com/Configuring-Photoshop-For-Pixel-Art&#34;&gt;configured&lt;/a&gt; for pixel art. At this point, I’d suggest creating all of the layers for your bitizen. &lt;strong&gt;Why use layers?&lt;/strong&gt; you might ask. Great question. Well, in order to quickly modify our base character, we want to have a separate layer for each of his features/body parts. So, create the following layers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Head&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mouth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hair&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eyes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shirt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pants&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, you can confidently modify any part of your Bitizen without the risk of destroying the rest. As I reference each part below, make sure you switch to the correct layer when drawing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;creating-the-head&#34;&gt;Creating The Head&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The head is perhaps the most complicated part of the Bitizen due to its odd shape and shading. The shape is due to the fact that the Bitizen is always looking in the forward direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start with a skin tone color (I have used #f7e0c2) and create a 10 x 6 rectangle in the center of your view like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/uploads/2011/Screen%20shot%202011-07-16%20at%201.22.24%20PM.png&#34; alt=&#34;Bitizen head&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, that the base head is in place, it’s time to draw the chin and neck. With the same color, indent one pixel in on the bottom and draw straight across. Finally, indent 3 more pixels in, and draw 4 pixels across. This is what your head should look like at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/uploads/2011/Screen%20shot%202011-07-16%20at%201.25.11%20PM.png&#34; alt=&#34;Head and Chin&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shading&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shading with pixel art is simply a matter of drawing with a darker shade of your main color. With the color chooser in PS and the skin tone still selected, drag the color down to a slightly darker shade and lowlight a 1 pixel line on the right side of the face. In our example the Bitizen is looking to his right, so his left will be shaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, add some more shading as you see necessary. If you look at mine, I have used a bit of shading to extend the head a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/uploads/2011/Screen%20shot%202011-07-16%20at%201.31.16%20PM.png&#34; alt=&#34;Head Shading&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hair, Mouth And Eyes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mouth and eyes are very simple with our Bitizens. The eyes are just single black pixels and the mouth is just a 4 pixel line using a darker shade of the skin tone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hair can be whatever you like. I have chosen a very simple hairstyle that you see quite often in the game with a simple shade of brown. I have also applied the same shading technique to the hair that I did to the face and neck. When you are finished, it should really start looking like a person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/uploads/2011/Screen%20shot%202011-07-16%20at%201.35.22%20PM.png&#34; alt=&#34;Hair and eyes&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;creating-the-body-legs-and-feet&#34;&gt;Creating The Body, Legs and Feet&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the body, start with 6 x 5 rectangle set to the color that you want to make the shirt. I chose #63cfea. For the pants, simply draw a solid line. Finally, the feet are just two 2px lines spread apart by two more pixels. If you notice in the game, to animate the movement of these guys, they simply alternate between this position and a centered 4px line. It just goes to show you how much things can be simplified when you use pixel art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/uploads/2011/Screen%20shot%202011-07-16%20at%201.43.55%20PM.png&#34; alt=&#34;Body and legs&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To finish up our Bitizen, we add single pixel dots for hands and a couple pixels for arms. After that, we add a collar and some simple shading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is what the completed Bitizen looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/uploads/2011/Screen%20shot%202011-07-16%20at%201.51.49%20PM.png&#34; alt=&#34;Completed Bitizen&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one thing to remember when creating pixel art for game is to keep it simple. Simplify everything. Take for example the Toy Story characters I made at the top of this post. They are &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; simplistic yet you recognize who they are right away. My 2.5 year old son was yelling “Woody! Buzz!” the entire time I was creating them. I think this is one of the largest challenges; sticking to “less is more”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some other fun things we can do to customize these guys. We can even do it in code! Next time, I will show you how to take a “base character” and customize its colors using Cocos 2D. This can save you even more time and energy when trying to make dynamic characters for your game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are feeling lazy and want to simply download my bitizen base, click the following link:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a final note, &lt;strong&gt;don’t just copy these guys for YOUR game&lt;/strong&gt;! I know it might seem tempting to give em a different shirt and plop them in your super rad fart machine RPG, but these guys are the product of the hard work of the guys at Nimble Bits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions or tips, please feel free to leave them in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would also &lt;strong&gt;LOVE&lt;/strong&gt; to see some of the custom bitizens you guys come up with. Please link to them in the comments if you end up creating some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Coding!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Configuring Photoshop For Pixel Art</title>
      <link>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2011/07/02/configuring-photoshop-for-pixel-art/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 02 Jul 2011 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate>
      <author>brandontreb@gmail.com (|ZeroCool|)</author><guid>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2011/07/02/configuring-photoshop-for-pixel-art/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;First things first. My wife and I had welcomed a new baby boy into the world on Monday so you guys are going to have to see the obligatory “dad” pics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here they are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/uploads/2011/a63ad6fab0dc4839a604e885a8a85f50_7.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Jack&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/uploads/2011/e77e30a4d504437ba75df8a7129f7d9d_7.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Jack&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, now that’s past us, let’s chat about pixel art. I have always been a HUGE fan of pixel art both in games and as a form of art. As an aspiring game developer (games coming soon 😉 ), I found pixel art a great fit for me. Not only is is aesthetically pleasing, it also allows developers to create “better” art than developer art. All it takes is a little patience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I’m going to share with you how I have configured Photoshop to create some pixel art and eventually show you how to make your own Bitizens from &lt;a href=&#34;http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tiny-tower/id422667065?mt=8&#34;&gt;Tiny Tower&lt;/a&gt; in a follow up post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of you might argue that Photoshop is not the way to go and that there are &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; tools for Pixel art. I have tried quite a few and keep coming back to PS because of some of it’s great features (shapes, layering, masks, gradients, noise filters, etc…). We can use a lot of these tools to our advantage when creating pixel art, PS just needs to be set up correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a heads up before I start, I’m using Adobe Photoshop CS3 for Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;change-the-way-photoshop-scales-images&#34;&gt;Change The Way Photoshop Scales Images&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/uploads/2011/bitizens-compare.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we need to change the way PS scales images. This is useful for when you are ready to export your sprites for production. By default, PS uses a Bicubic algorithm when you want to enlarge an image. This generally produces a very blurry effect. It’s quite useful in many cases, but terrible for pixel art. Here, we need to tell PS to use a “Nearest Neighbor” scaling algorithm. This will preserver all of our edges without PS mucking with the blending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To change this setting, navigate to &lt;strong&gt;Photoshop-&amp;gt;Preferences-&amp;gt;General&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/uploads/2011/Screen%20shot%202011-07-02%20at%2010.34.22%20AM.png&#34; alt=&#34;Nearest Neighbor&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only setting you need to modify is “Image Interpolation”. Make sure to change it to “Nearest Neighbor”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;enabling-a-grid&#34;&gt;Enabling A Grid&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When creating pixel art, it is very useful to have a grid in place in order to determine where to place your next pixel. Without it, you are just blindly placing them. To turn on and configure a grid in PS, navigate to &lt;strong&gt;Photoshop-&amp;gt;Preferences-&amp;gt;Guides, Grid, Slices &amp;amp; Count…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/uploads/2011/Screen%20shot%202011-07-02%20at%2010.42.00%20AM.png&#34; alt=&#34;1px gridlines&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure to set &lt;strong&gt;Gridline every&lt;/strong&gt; to 1 and &lt;strong&gt;Subdivisions&lt;/strong&gt; to 1. This will create a 1px grid on for you to use as a guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have configured the grid, click on &lt;strong&gt;View-&amp;gt;Show-&amp;gt;Grid&lt;/strong&gt; to display it. You might have to do this for every document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;configuring-the-pencil-tool&#34;&gt;Configuring the Pencil Tool&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When creating pixel art in PS, the pencil tool is your best friend. You will use it ~95% of the time when drawing. We need to make sure that the pencil draws single pixel dots without any interpolation. With the pencil tool selected, click the dropdown next to &lt;strong&gt;brush&lt;/strong&gt;, tap the &lt;strong&gt;arrow&lt;/strong&gt; and then select &lt;strong&gt;basic brushes&lt;/strong&gt;. When prompted to replace current brushes, click &lt;strong&gt;OK&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/uploads/2011/Screen%20shot%202011-07-02%20at%2010.57.03%20AM.png&#34; alt=&#34;Basic Brushes&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, select the 1 px brush (it should be in the top left). Most of the time, you will want to draw with single pixels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/uploads/2011/Screen%20shot%202011-07-02%20at%2010.53.40%20AM.png&#34; alt=&#34;1 px brush&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;creating-a-new-document&#34;&gt;Creating A New Document&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deciding on a document size can be tricky. You generally want to create your document as small as possible to avoid having to do more work than you need. The size depends on how “pixellated” you want your art to look after scaling. Basically, using the scaling we chose above (nearest neighbor), the “pixels” will just increase in size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a blown up view of our 15×25 image that we will use in the next tutorial to create a Bitizen from Tiny Tower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/uploads/2011/Screen%20shot%202011-07-02%20at%2012.31.54%20PM.png&#34; alt=&#34;New Document&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the zoom level isn’t too high, we are seeing grid slices every 2 pixels rather than 1. As you zoom, you will see the grid size increasing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;multiple-zoom-levels-in-view&#34;&gt;Multiple Zoom Levels In View&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One cool trick with PS is, it allows you to have multiple windows of the same document open. The reason this is handy is you can see various zoom levels for your artwork all at once. While drawing each pixel zoomed in, you can see the result in the desired resolution. This helps out dramatically when you are trying to fine tune your work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do this, go to &lt;strong&gt;Window-&amp;gt;Arrange-&amp;gt;New Window for [projectname.psd]&lt;/strong&gt; Now you can control the zoom level of each window individually.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/uploads/2011/jharrington_cover150.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
Wow, I can’t believe it has been over a year since the release of my book &lt;a href=&#34;http://manning.com/trebitowski/&#34;&gt;iPhone And iPad In Action&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, we have sold over 6,000 copies and have just have released in numerous languages!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with all iOS (tech books really), my book was almost outdated the moment it hit the shelves due to Apple’s constant SDK release cycle. My book ended with “here is what’s coming in iOS 4…”, and didn’t hit the shelves until after iOS 4 was released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was asked last year by &lt;a href=&#34;http://manning.com&#34;&gt;Manning Publishing&lt;/a&gt; to write the 3rd version of the book to include all of the 4.0 SDK changes. Due to some huge changes in my life, I was unable to accept and they had to find the 4th author to work on the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.manning.com/jharrington/&#34;&gt;Jocelyn Harrington&lt;/a&gt; released the 3rd version of the book titled “iOS 4 In Action”. Here is a bit about this version from their site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written for Xcode 4, iOS 4 in Action guides you from setting up your development environment,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;through coding your first app, all the way to selling in the App Store. Work through sample&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;applications including a chat client, a video game, an interactive map, background audio,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and more as you explore the iOS 4 SDK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some highlights about what’s inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full coverage of iOS SDK 4.3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mastering Xcode 4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multitasking for iPhone and iPad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Game Center, iAd, and AirPrint&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local and push notification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implementing in-app purchasing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a significant update and I’m really excited to get my copies in the mail. As soon as I do so, I’ll do a couple giveaways on my blog. Make sure you stick around or &lt;a href=&#34;http://feeds.feedburner.com/brandontreb&#34;&gt;subscribe to the RSS feed&lt;/a&gt; so you don’t miss it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;freebie&#34;&gt;Freebie&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manning is allowing anyone to download the full &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.manning.com/jharrington/iOS4iASample-ch21.pdf&#34;&gt;Chapter 21&lt;/a&gt; on multitasking now for free! &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.manning.com/jharrington/iOS4iASample-ch21.pdf&#34;&gt;Go grab your copy&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Coding!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;﻿﻿This post is part of &lt;a href=&#34;http://idevblogaday.com/&#34;&gt;iDevBlogADay&lt;/a&gt;, a group of indie iOS development blogs featuring two posts per day.

      <title>Check Out AutoCorrector &#43; Promo Codes!</title>
      <link>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2011/05/27/check-out-autocorrector-promo-codes/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 27 May 2011 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate>
      <author>brandontreb@gmail.com (|ZeroCool|)</author><guid>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2011/05/27/check-out-autocorrector-promo-codes/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;![](/uploads/2011/iPhone Screenshot 1.jpeg) So, this blog post might sound like a lame press release, but I actually do want to talk about a cool app some buddies of mine created. Just read it in a cheesy used car salesman voice and it will be a lot &lt;del&gt;less&lt;/del&gt; more enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-problem&#34;&gt;The Problem&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever tried to type shorthand text to a friend and it come out completely wrong? For example: AFK -&amp;gt; AFT, AKA -&amp;gt; Aja. Or maybe your friend has an uncommon nickname that auto corrects to something hilarious…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;enter-autocorrector&#34;&gt;Enter AutoCorrector&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/cruffenach&#34;&gt;@cruffenach&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/matt_tuzzolo&#34;&gt;@matt_tuzzolo&lt;/a&gt; , and &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/damian_r&#34;&gt;@damian_r&lt;/a&gt; just released an app for the iPhone called &lt;a href=&#34;http://bit.ly/imG1JN&#34;&gt;AutoCorrector&lt;/a&gt;! It’s an app that allows you add words to your iPhone’s auto correct dictionary. Once added, the iPhone will stop pestering you to auto correct uncommon/shorthand words that you frequently type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;how-it-works&#34;&gt;How It Works&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding words directly to the dictionary would be against the Apple SDK terms of use as it would require your app to run outside of it’s “sandbox”. However, clever @cruffenach realized that when you add comma separated words to a contact’s nickname in the address book, they get added automatically to the iPhone’s dictionary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This actually makes a lot of sense when you think about it. If you have a friend with a nickname, chances are you will want to address that person at some point by that nickname. It would get very annoying if you iPhone tried to autocorrect you every time you tried to type that friend’s name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Auto corrector simply uses the AddressBook framework to maintain a contact with a nickname containing a list of words you have added. When you add a new word, it simply updates this contact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;why-use-auto-corrector&#34;&gt;Why Use Auto Corrector?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure you could just do this manually, however it’s a pain and requires too many steps (6 taps vs. 2 taps for AC). Also, auto corrector provides a beautiful interface for entering and managing words you have added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Word Packs!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bundled with AC, comes the SMS shorthand word pack with 116 words ready to install instantly. In the near future, the guys plan on creating a ton more word packs as well as provide a portal for community packs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m pretty excited about this app and really think it has a good future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://bit.ly/imG1JN&#34;&gt;Download it here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think? Would/did you buy it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some promo codes!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Officially Running On Jekyll</title>
      <link>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2011/04/06/officially-running-on-jekyll/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 06 Apr 2011 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate>
      <author>brandontreb@gmail.com (|ZeroCool|)</author><guid>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2011/04/06/officially-running-on-jekyll/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, I have finally made the switch from &lt;a href=&#34;http://wordpress.org&#34;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;http://jekyllrb.com/&#34;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; and couldn’t be happier. Here are some of the bonuses I have seen thus far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SPEED: Just click around on my site. It is screaming fast now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resources: Checking top on my server reveals that I have a TON of extra resources (which makes sense since Jekyll sites are way more lightweight).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ease of blogging: Ok, WordPress was pretty easy too, however, I was really starting to get sick of the post interface. I switch to Tumblr at some point simply for it’s minimalist interface. WordPress’ is gross and TinyMCE (the WYSIWG editor) is terrible. I love writing in TextMate!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Offline publishing. I can write my posts anywhere since they are just .md (markdown) files. Check out &lt;a href=&#34;http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax&#34;&gt;Daring Fireball’s&lt;/a&gt; great writeup on this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Portability: Have you have tried to move your WordPress site? Yeah, it’s about as fun as chewing on tin foil with metal fillings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on content: WordPress has quite a bit of focus on using rich media in your posts which tends to take away from the content if you are not careful. There is something about writing in a text editor that makes you forget about images/video/etc… unless it’s totally needed. So don’t be surprised if my posts aren’t as “rich”. (Hopefully they will be more clever &lt;img src=&#34;https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/uploads/2011/simple-smile.png&#34; alt=&#34;:)&#34;&gt; )&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really urge you to see for yourself what it’s like blogging with Jekyll. I will do a writeup on my conversion process in the near future to help aid others in the switch. Until then, you can google around and find tons of great resources.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Free App Idea: Drop Tunes</title>
      <link>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2011/03/01/free-app-idea-drop-tunes/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Mar 2011 01:00:00 -0600</pubDate>
      <author>brandontreb@gmail.com (|ZeroCool|)</author><guid>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2011/03/01/free-app-idea-drop-tunes/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this already exists, if so, please link me to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The idea&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drop music into your Dropbox folder on your computer. Then open up the app which presents you with an iPod like interface for this music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The genius&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s great about it is, you have all of you music on your iPhone without using up disk space. Of course you may need to upgrade your Dropbox account to something greater than 2GBs to see any real value.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Smart Lockscreen Creator Released &#43; Promo Codes</title>
      <link>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2011/02/24/smart-lockscreen-creator-released-promo-codes/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 24 Feb 2011 01:00:00 -0600</pubDate>
      <author>brandontreb@gmail.com (|ZeroCool|)</author><guid>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2011/02/24/smart-lockscreen-creator-released-promo-codes/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My latest iOS app, Smart Lockscreen Creator has just released on iPhone for $.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://itunes.apple.com/app/smart-lockscreen-creator/id419890996?mt=8&#34;&gt;Download It Here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-idea&#34;&gt;The Idea&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently your lockscreen on your iOS device is nothing more than a pretty watch with a background. Jailbreakers have solved this issue with an incredible application called intelliscreen, which adds lots of interesting information to it. However, you and I are Apple fanboys and won’t violate our precious iPhones with jailbreaking. Enter Smart Lockscreen Creator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smart Lockscreen Creator allows you to build a completely custom (and smart) lockscreen image within the application. You then set this image as your lockscreen background. The following items are currently supported by the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Current weather, condition, high and low for any city/region in the World&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weekly forecast for any city/region in the World&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monthly calendar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Custom text&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blank space (useful when customizing the look of your lockscreen)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Line separator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many more in the works!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some promo codes. If you fail to grab one and have some interest in reviewing the app on your site, I would be happy to email you one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FMP9LRW4FP99&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MH7XHH3FLH4P&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JH9E47JXP9KA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RYRAPRARPAJ3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4FKKW6LN7W9J&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any suggestion for lockscreen “widgets”, don’t hesitate to post them here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please give some review love as well 😉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://itunes.apple.com/app/smart-lockscreen-creator/id419890996?mt=8&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/uploads/2011/appstore1.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;appstore1&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>It&amp;#8217;s Elementary My Dear Watson</title>

&lt;p&gt;IBM&amp;rsquo;s Watson on Jeopardy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night marked the beginning of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www-943.ibm.com/innovation/us/watson/&#34;&gt;IBM Jeopardy challenge&lt;/a&gt;. For those of you who don’t know, IBM has been working for some time on a system (named Watson) that has overcome some amazing challenges. The goal: to build an entirely self-contained system that can beat the World’s best Jeopardy players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I’m not going to give you a rundown on it as I’m sure that you can (or have already) read it on a website far more popular than mine. I just wanted to publicly geek out for a second…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was watching the episode of Jeopardy with my wife, and at first glance she was like “duh, of course a computer could win at Jeopardy”. This made me realize that to a non engineer, this seems like a trivial task since computers are magical Facebook boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now me on the other hand, I was giddy to the point of almost wetting myself. Seeing how far we have come in AI development and language processing is absolutely incredible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I for one, will be glued to my tv tonight to watch Watson’s next round of Jeopardy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/office-spacejpg.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/uploads/2011/office-spacejpg.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;office-spacejpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mondays…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other day, I was faced with an interesting programming challenge and wanted to share my solution. I just submitted a pretty interesting app to the app store that does a number of things (more details soon). Among those things is the ability to generate a calendar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-problem&#34;&gt;The Problem&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generating the calendar was the easy part, however when displayed, I wanted it to highlight every Monday of the month. This turned out to be a bit trickier than I imagined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really the main challenge here was to determine which day contained the &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; Monday of the month. After that, we just loop incrementing by 7 and are done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;looking-at-the-date-helpers&#34;&gt;Looking At The Date Helpers&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at what I had to work with in NSDate, NSCalendar, and NSDateComponents, I really found only 2 things that could help me. From NSDateComponents, I could figure out the current day (numeric) and the current day of the week (numeric). Knowing this information was very important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-solution&#34;&gt;The Solution&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having the current day and day of the week allowed me to find the date of the Monday on the current week. This was the first challenge as demonstrated below. Assume weekdayComponents is the NSDateComponents generated from the current date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;code class=’objc’&amp;gt;NSInteger weekday = [weekdayComponents weekday];
NSInteger day         = [weekdayComponents day];
// First, find how many days we are from Monday
int daysAwayFromMonday = weekday - 2;


// Now resolve the monday of this week
int mondayThisWeek = day - daysAwayFromMonday;


// Check if monday this week falls in last month
if(mondayThisWeek &amp;lt;= 0) {
mondayThisWeek = day + (7 - daysAwayFromMonday);
}&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;mondayThisWeek will now contain the day number of the Monday of the current week. If that Monday falls on the previous month, mondayThisWeek will be negative. Line 12 resolves that by carrying it into next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we just loop subtracting 7 from that Monday until mondayThisWeek is less than 7 to get the first Monday of the month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;code class=’objc’&amp;gt;while(mondayThisWeek &amp;gt; 7) {
    mondayThisWeek -= 7;
}&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;And there you have it. mondayThisWeek (improperly named at this point) will contain the day number of the first Monday for the current month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, this was quite a round-a-bout way to find this value. If you have a better solution, please feel free to trash on mine in the comments 😉 .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey guys,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to thank everyone for letting me be a part of the iDevBlogADay community. You guys have been super supportive and I really appreciate all of the commenting, retweeting, and upvoting of my iDevBlogADay articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have found myself in a position with life (work + family) where I may no longer be able to consistently write a post per week. So, after 2 months of writing, it is time for me to pass the torch to the next blogger on the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will still continue to blog (and continue my Twitter For Mac Series), so I really encourage you to subscribe to my &lt;a href=&#34;http://feeds2.feedburner.com/brandontreb&#34;&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/brandontreb&#34;&gt;Twitter feed&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks again and Happy Coding!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/share&#34;&gt;Tweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What Does Your Workspace Look Like?</title>
      <link>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2010/12/30/what-does-your-workspace-look-like/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 30 Dec 2010 01:00:00 -0600</pubDate>
      <author>brandontreb@gmail.com (|ZeroCool|)</author><guid>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2010/12/30/what-does-your-workspace-look-like/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am always very fascinated with the workspaces of others and frequently check out Lifehacker’s posts on their &lt;a href=&#34;http://lifehacker.com/tag/featured-workspace/&#34;&gt;featured workspaces&lt;/a&gt;. So, for this iDevBlogADay post, I thought I would keep it short and simple with a request. I want to see (and I’m sure others do too) photos of YOUR workspaces (especially those of you with s&lt;a href=&#34;http://gamesfromwithin.com/my-standing-desk-experiment&#34;&gt;tanding desks&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing someone’s work area is especially inspring to me, I love seeing where others create and what they surround themselves with for inspiration and motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I’ll start by sharing a photo of my current workspace. This is where the magic happens…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/uploads/2010/image.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;image&#34;&gt;
Within my workspace, you will find:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Macbook Pro&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;24” Apple LED Display&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iPad with Kensington Keyboard Case&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Logitec Speakers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Just Like Jesus” Daily Devotional&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Embark (Target Brand) Fitness Ball&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple wireless keyboard and Magic Mouse&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bonsai Tree (coming soon &lt;img src=&#34;https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/uploads/2010/simple-smile.png&#34; alt=&#34;:)&#34;&gt; )&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there you have, this is my workspace. Please post a link to your workspace photos or email them to brandontreb [at] gmail [dot] com and I will append them to this post. I can’t wait!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update: Here are some workspaces submitted by readers so far:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife has this interesting problem of having vivid dreams about whatever she was last watching/discussing before bed. Last night, I was explaining to her all about memory leaks as I had a discussion with a coworker earlier in the day about them. She was curious, so I gave her a very simple explanation in which she could understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in the night (about 3 am), my son woke up screaming. He must have had a bad dream or something; so, I went in there, put him down and went back to bed. My wife rolls over, looks me straight in the eye and says in a groggy voice “Does he have a memory leak?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I laughed so hard it woke her up. I then appropriately responded with “I have to go take a memory leak”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am now offering advertising in the sidebar for the killer price of $10. I felt that the Google Adsense ads looked super spammy and this is a much cleaner way to handle things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So please give me a hand with these server costs, show off your sweet apps/site, and purchase an ad on the blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either click the Advertise Here button on the side or click this link &lt;a href=&#34;http://bit.ly/gMYepc&#34;&gt;http://bit.ly/gMYepc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found this article while browsing reddit and was blown away. I have been a little mystified at the potential algorithms used by notch to render the terrain in Minecraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This provides a killer explanation of some interesting algorithms that can be used to generate such worlds. It also contains the source code that you can download and play with.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>XCode Tips And Shortcuts To Improve Your Workflow</title>
      <link>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2010/11/18/xcode-tips-and-shortcuts-to-improve-your-workflow/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 18 Nov 2010 01:00:00 -0600</pubDate>
      <author>brandontreb@gmail.com (|ZeroCool|)</author><guid>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2010/11/18/xcode-tips-and-shortcuts-to-improve-your-workflow/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my first &lt;a href=&#34;http://idevblogaday.com&#34;&gt;#iDevBlogADay&lt;/a&gt; post and I wanted to give a quick intro before jumping in. My name is Brandon Trebitowski and I’m a software developer and author from Albuquerque, New Mexico. I graduated from the University of New Mexico in 2008 with a bachelors degree in computer science. For the past 2 years, I have been writing mobile applications (primarily for the iPhone) for &lt;a href=&#34;http://elctech.com/&#34;&gt;ELC Technologies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also started &lt;a href=&#34;http://icodeblog.com&#34;&gt;http://icodeblog.com&lt;/a&gt; and currently write on it about once a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;a-post-on-xcode-shortcuts&#34;&gt;A Post On XCode Shortcuts?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.1729.us/xcode/Xcode%20Shortcuts.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/uploads/2010/Xcode%20Shortcuts.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;XCode Shortcuts&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Well, I’m sure by now, you have seen countless &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.1729.us/xcode/Xcode%20Shortcuts.png&#34;&gt;infographics and “cheat sheets”&lt;/a&gt; chock full of XCode shortcuts, tips, etc… These can be great resources, however, if you are anything like me, you see these, tweet the link, and move on never looking at them again. The only difference between these and the XCode key-bindings menu IMHO is a fancy background. So, I thought I would share some of the most important shortcuts that I have adopted to really improve my workflow. We spend so much time inside of XCode, it is worth the time to learn some of these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;build-commands&#34;&gt;Build Commands&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By now, I would hope that you don’t click the “Build and Go/Debug” with your mouse whenever you want to run your application. If you do, no worries, here are some of the build quick keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**⌘ return – **This builds and launches the application in debug mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**shift ⌘ return **– Kills the running application in the simulator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**shift ⌘ k – **Cleans the build target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**shift ⌘ a – **Build and Analyze. This is quite possible the most important command to learn. This invokes the static analyzer to help spot memory issues in your code. Run this as early and often as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My general workflow after writing a bit of code is to kill the last run, clean, analyze (hopefully not spend time on memory issues), and then build and debug. These 4 commands in sequence are much faster than searching out the menu items for each of those commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;file-management-and-navigation&#34;&gt;File Management and Navigation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Navigating around files is one of the most common tasks you will perform in XCode. It is really to your advantage to speed things up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;option ⌘ ↑&lt;/strong&gt; – This quickly switches between your .h and .m file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**⌘ ↑ – **Move to the top of the file&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**⌘ ↓ – **Move to the bottom of the file &lt;img src=&#34;https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/uploads/2010/Screen-shot-2010-11-18-at-8.14.35-AM.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;Screen shot 2010-11-18 at 8.14.35 AM&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**shift ⌘ d – **This was recently showed to my by &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/cruffenach&#34;&gt;@cruffenach&lt;/a&gt; and it has drastically sped up my workflow. This is the command for “Open Quickly”. It brings up a small window with a search box at the top. Typing in the box instantly searches your project and allows you to quickly open up files by pressing return on the selected file. I can’t believe I had been using XCode for so long before I found out about this command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;binding-your-own-quick-keys&#34;&gt;Binding Your Own Quick Keys&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some commands simply don’t have quick keys. For example, I constantly use the &lt;strong&gt;Edit -&amp;gt; Sort -&amp;gt; By Name&lt;/strong&gt; command to sort my source files alphabetically. By default, you must click through all of the menus and select the command to get it to work. However, XCode (like most OSX applications) will allow you to define your own quick keys and here’s how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open up the XCode Preferences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click on the Key Bindings tab&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navigate to the command that you want to bind keys for. (hint: they are organized the same way they in the top menu)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you have found the command, double click in the Key column&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press the keys that you wish to bind (I bound &lt;strong&gt;option shift ⌘ s&lt;/strong&gt; for sorting)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there are any conflicts, XCode will let you know. Otherwise, press apply and you’re good to go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;wrap-up&#34;&gt;Wrap Up&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, this concludes my relatively short first post for &lt;a href=&#34;http://idevblogaday.com&#34;&gt;#idevblogaday&lt;/a&gt;. If you have any shortcuts of your own that you can’t live without, please share them in the comments. I’m always up to improve my workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you to everyone (especially &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/mysterycoconut&#34;&gt;@mysterycoconut&lt;/a&gt;) for allowing me to be a part of this community and I look forward to sharing my knowledge and experiences with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Coding!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>RE: Android Developer Income Report</title>
      <link>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2010/11/08/re-android-developer-income-report/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 08 Nov 2010 01:00:00 -0600</pubDate>
      <author>brandontreb@gmail.com (|ZeroCool|)</author><guid>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2010/11/08/re-android-developer-income-report/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kreci.net/reports/android-developer-income-report/&#34;&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt; was a very interesting with some insight into the Android Market. Basically, this indie Android developer has published 6 free applications and is making more than $1,000.00 per month off of advertisements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of my apps has been ever promoted in Top of Android Market&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am providing only free apps (mostly due of Android Market limitations)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if I would be able to sell apps I would not use it as main income source… (I believe that you still can make more from ads…)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;via &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kreci.net/reports/android-developer-income-report/&#34;&gt;Android Developer Income Report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think there is an interesting experiment here. I am going to attempt this. Making super simple novelty apps (very low barrier to entry) that are free with ad support. I know this just further convolutes the crap that is the Android Market, but it would be fun to test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I actually end up doing this, I will publish some results here.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What not to do in life | TKs weblog</title>
      <link>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2010/11/05/what-not-to-do-in-life-tks-weblog/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 05 Nov 2010 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate>
      <author>brandontreb@gmail.com (|ZeroCool|)</author><guid>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2010/11/05/what-not-to-do-in-life-tks-weblog/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here is a great article about some advice given to a 22 year old starting his life journey. These points are applicable to anyone, but found them especially applicable to software developers in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tawheedkader.com/2010/11/what-not-to-do-in-life/&#34;&gt;http://www.tawheedkader.com/2010/11/what-not-to-do-in-life/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few that I particularly enjoyed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not ever work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picasso used to paint all the time, Henry Moore sculpt the whole day. Others would have thought they were working themselves to death. They actually were reenergizing and reinvigorating themselves. Do what you enjoy doing. Do not ever work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not go into any competition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quality has no competition. Only mediocrity has competition. If you do what you do at the highest quality you have no competition. Quality creates a moat around yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this says to me is “Love what you are doing, and don’t make crap!”. These are super wise points that we often overlook. Take for example the iTunes App Store. 300,000 apps where ~ 290,000 of them are total crap. People just writing apps for the sake of making money and not truly enjoying what they are doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are competing on crap, you are always going to lose.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>6 Traits Of A Successful Developer</title>
      <link>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2010/09/16/6-traits-of-a-successful-developer/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2010 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate>
      <author>brandontreb@gmail.com (|ZeroCool|)</author><guid>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2010/09/16/6-traits-of-a-successful-developer/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed this article on traits of developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.turnleafdesign.com/6-traits-of-successful-developers&#34;&gt;http://www.turnleafdesign.com/6-traits-of-successful-developers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my experience, developers tend to become arrogant and totally ignore #1 (see Windows Devs). I feel that this is the most important trait of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For a developer to be successful over any period of time a continued commitment to learning is absolutely vital. The field is too large, too quickly changing, and too in depth for any developer to ever “know it all.” Luckily there are a lot of resources a developer can use to learn; books, co-workers, classes, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.turnleafdesign.com/&#34;&gt;blogs&lt;/a&gt;, among many others.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SEO: Works Every Time</title>
      <link>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2010/09/16/seo-works-every-time/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2010 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate>
      <author>brandontreb@gmail.com (|ZeroCool|)</author><guid>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2010/09/16/seo-works-every-time/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So I received an internal email at work the other day about how we could SEO our company website (&lt;a href=&#34;http://elctech.com&#34;&gt;http://elctech.com&lt;/a&gt;). Here was my suggestion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Just put up a few #  tags that state (in this order) Rails, Coding, Consulting, Porn, Free Porn, Porn on Rails, Viagra, iPhone, development, hot chicks, elc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guaranteed hits!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genius right? So after a while, a fellow employee (&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/maxmurphy&#34;&gt;@maxmurphy&lt;/a&gt;) suggested we implement this rails solution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;code class=’ruby’&amp;gt;[&amp;#34;Rails&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Coding&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Consulting&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Porn&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Free Porn&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Porn on Rails&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;Viagra&amp;#34;,
&amp;#34;iPhone&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;development&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;hot chicks&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;elc&amp;#34;].each do |seo|
  &amp;#34;#{seo} \n ELC ROCKS #{seo}&amp;#34;
end&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perfect!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to steal this and you too can be an SEO Guru!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>HECK YES C Macro, For When Something Is REALLY True</title>
      <link>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2010/04/15/heck-yes-c-macro-for-when-something-is-really-true/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Quite possibly the most useful macro you will ever use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;#define HECK\_YES true &amp;amp;&amp;amp; true
 
// Usage
if(self.sleepy)
{
   self.needsCoffee = HECK_YES;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;|&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now if only I could replace semi colons with exclamation points…&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/kindel-dev-gameboy.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/uploads/2010/kindel-dev-gameboy-500x333.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; title=&#34;kindel-dev-gameboy&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the success of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.apple.com/iphone/appstore/&#34; title=&#34;App Store&#34;&gt;Apple App Store&lt;/a&gt;, it seems that everyone is wanting a piece of the pie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon is now looking to throw their hat into the ring and is releasing their own dev kit for their ever so popular Kindle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html/?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;docId=1000476231&#34;&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html/?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;docId=1000476231&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears that big name game developers Electronic Arts is also getting involved (WTH?!?!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This just seems like it will be an epic fail. Who really wants to play video games on their Kindle? Maybe they can port &lt;a href=&#34;http://brandontreb.com/code-monkey-music-video/&#34;&gt;Kirby’s Dreamland&lt;/a&gt; from the original Game Boy &lt;img src=&#34;https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/uploads/2010/simple-smile.png&#34; alt=&#34;:)&#34;&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;p class=&amp;#34;wp-caption-text&amp;#34;&amp;gt;
  Image via Wikipedia
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was at Wally-World the other day getting a movie from RedBox with my wife when I noticed some guy enter in a code into the machine. The code was BREAKROOM. After watching him for a moment, I realized this code entitled him a free DVD rental.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, RedBox is pretty stinking cheap ($1.50/night), but if you’re an avid movie watcher, this really adds up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I did some searching on the Google machine and sure enough, there are new RedBox codes that go into circulation every day. Each one giving you a free DVD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site that offers the RedBox codes is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.insideredbox.com/redbox-codes/&#34;&gt;http://www.insideredbox.com/redbox-codes/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users submit the codes and update the site with the last time they were used. That way, you always know which codes are currently working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You simply need to enter the coupon code from the main screen or just before checkout at your local Redbox kiosk. When you do, you will receive a one-day free rental. Any additional days you keep the movie will be charged at the usual $1.50/day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update: &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/diemer&#34;&gt;@diemer&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter pointed out to me that inside Redbox also has an iPhone app. The link for the app is &lt;a href=&#34;http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/inside-redbox-pro/id306217360?mt=8&#34;&gt;http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/inside-redbox-pro/id306217360?mt=8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I may actually cancel my Netflix account now…&lt;/p&gt;

      <author>brandontreb@gmail.com (|ZeroCool|)</author><guid>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2009/12/17/great-list-of-algorithm-programming-tutorials/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently &lt;a href=&#34;http://TopCoder.com&#34;&gt;TopCoder.com&lt;/a&gt; posted a list of algorithm tutorials from some of their “top coders”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tutorials are very comprehensive and pretty much sum my undergraduate computer science degree up in one page &lt;img src=&#34;https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/uploads/2009/simple-smile.png&#34; alt=&#34;:)&#34;&gt; This page is a great resource for anyone that does any amount of coding…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the tutorials include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Greedy algorithms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Various sort and search techniques&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data structures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graph theory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the link to the Top Coder Tutorials:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.topcoder.com/tc?d1=tutorials&amp;amp;d2=alg_index&amp;amp;module=Static&#34;&gt;http://www.topcoder.com/tc?d1=tutorials&amp;amp;d2=alg_index&amp;amp;module=Static&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Programming Tip Of The Day #2 &amp;#8211; Difference Between i&#43;&#43; and &#43;&#43;i</title>
      <link>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2009/12/04/programming-tip-of-the-day-2-difference-between-i-and-i/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 04 Dec 2009 01:00:00 -0600</pubDate>
      <author>brandontreb@gmail.com (|ZeroCool|)</author><guid>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2009/12/04/programming-tip-of-the-day-2-difference-between-i-and-i/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;To some, this should seem a bit obvious and if I am insulting your intelligence by discussing it, I am sorry. But, one of the main reasons I want to discuss this topic is, I was asked this question in a job interview for Lockheed Martin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the difference between i++ and ++i?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is actually quite simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-first-evaluates-the-value-of-i-and-then-increments-it&#34;&gt;i++ first evaluates the value of i and then increments it&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-increments-the-value-of-i-and-then-evaluates-it&#34;&gt;++i increments the value of i and then evaluates it&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a brief example to demonstrate what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;// Example: i++ 
$i = 5;
echo &amp;#34;The value of i is &amp;#34; . $i++ ;
// Output &amp;#34;The value of i is 5&amp;#34;
// i = 6
 
// Example: ++i 
$i = 5;
echo &amp;#34;The value of i is &amp;#34; . ++$i;
// Output &amp;#34;The value of i is 6&amp;#34;
// i = 6
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;|&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, now if you are ever asked about this in an interview, you will have a response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy programming!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Programming Tip Of The Day #1 &amp;#8211; Ternary Operator</title>
      <link>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2009/12/03/programming-tip-of-the-day-1-ternary-operator/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 03 Dec 2009 01:00:00 -0600</pubDate>
      <author>brandontreb@gmail.com (|ZeroCool|)</author><guid>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2009/12/03/programming-tip-of-the-day-1-ternary-operator/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, I though I’d start this series called Programming Tip Of The Day to write about useful things I come across in programming. Both to educate my readers and as a personal archive of ideas and tips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will kick it off today with a quick rant about the &lt;strong&gt;ternary operator&lt;/strong&gt;. I &amp;lt;3 the ternary operator. It’s quick, efficient and saves a lot of ugly code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you who don’t know, the ternary operator is made up of 3 elements: The condition and two results. It is of the form:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;condition--result-if-true--result-if-false&#34;&gt;(condition) ? (result if true) : (result if false);&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is much nicer than an if statement. So here is a brief example about how a ternary operator can replace an if-statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;if-statement&#34;&gt;if-statement&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;code class=’c’&amp;gt;if(isSnowing) {
    iMustBe = &amp;#34;cold&amp;#34;;
} else {
    iMustBe = &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34;;
}&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;same-thing-using-ternary&#34;&gt;Same thing using ternary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;code class=’c’&amp;gt;iMustBe = isSnowing ? &amp;#34;cold&amp;#34; : &amp;#34;warm&amp;#34;;&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is so much easier to read (IMHO). You can even do clever things in printing. Here is a small example in PHP for using the ternary operator when doing an echo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;code class=’php’&amp;gt;&amp;lt;?php
  echo &amp;#34;I am a &amp;#34;.((height &amp;gt; 72) ? &amp;#34;tall&amp;#34; : &amp;#34;short&amp;#34;).&amp;#34; person!&amp;#34;;
?&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most languages support the ternary operator. Check out &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ternary_operation&#34;&gt;this wiki page&lt;/a&gt; if you want more info.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy programming!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mac OSX Tip: Hotkey To Hide/Show the Dock</title>
      <link>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2009/12/02/mac-osx-tip-hotkey-to-hideshow-the-dock/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While mashing the keyboard (as I often do when debuggin poorly written outsourced code), I stumbled upon a very useful OSX hotkey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-option-d&#34;&gt;⌘-option-d&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This command will cause the Dock to go in and out of auto-hide mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not the most useful, but very helpful to geeks like me who rearrange their desktop every day.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PHP Class To Interface With Many URL Shortening Services</title>
      <link>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2009/11/16/php-class-to-interface-with-many-url-shortening-services/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 16 Nov 2009 01:00:00 -0600</pubDate>
      <author>brandontreb@gmail.com (|ZeroCool|)</author><guid>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2009/11/16/php-class-to-interface-with-many-url-shortening-services/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the explosion of Twitter and such services, the need to have long URLs shortened has drastically increased. Naturally, many services to shorten URLs have sprung up as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of these services (that are worth using), have some sort of API that will allow developers to send a long URL to them, have it shortened and then returned. This type of service allows other developers to write applications that have the ability to shorten URLs right inside of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I had to write a PHP class to work with URL shorteners. So, I made it support multiple shortening services and have decided to share it with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The class is called &lt;a href=&#34;http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/URLShortener.class.php_1.zip&#34;&gt;URLShortener.class.php&lt;/a&gt; and it supports the following shortening services:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://j.mp&#34;&gt;j.mp&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&#34;http://bit.ly&#34;&gt;bit.ly&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://tr.im&#34;&gt;tr.im&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TinyURL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://is.gd&#34;&gt;is.gd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://u.nu&#34;&gt;u.nu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linkyy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your own custom shortening service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples of how to use the class in your own applications:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;code class=’php’&amp;gt;&amp;lt;?php
     /* Basic: */
     $s = new URLShortener(‘tr.im’);
     echo $s-&amp;gt;shorten(&amp;#34;http://brandontreb.com&amp;#34;);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;/* Using API Key and Login */
$s = new URLShortener(‘j.mp’);
$s-&amp;gt;login = ‘brandontreb’;
$s-&amp;gt;APIKey = ‘R_2a413ebd15254a72b500ec2ce83f982d’;
echo $s-&amp;gt;shorten(&amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://brandontreb.com&#34;&gt;http://brandontreb.com&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;);
/* Custom URL */
// Just make sure you put %s and it will be
// replaced with the long URL
$s = new URLShortener(‘custom’,
‘&lt;a href=&#34;http://b1t.me/api/shorten.xml/%25s%E2%80%99&#34;&gt;http://b1t.me/api/shorten.xml/%s’&lt;/a&gt;);
echo $s-&amp;gt;shorten(&amp;quot;&lt;a href=&#34;http://brandontreb.com&#34;&gt;http://brandontreb.com&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;,false);&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;
?&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may download my URLShortener PHP class &lt;a href=&#34;http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/URLShortener.class.php_1.zip&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feel free to leave any questions or comments in the comments section.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Money You Might Be Missing Out On &amp;#8211; LinkShare API Integration</title>
      <link>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2009/11/12/money-you-might-be-missing-out-on-linkshare-api-integration/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 12 Nov 2009 01:00:00 -0600</pubDate>
      <author>brandontreb@gmail.com (|ZeroCool|)</author><guid>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2009/11/12/money-you-might-be-missing-out-on-linkshare-api-integration/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://linkshare.com&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/uploads/2009/logo.gif&#34; alt=&#34;logo&#34; title=&#34;logo&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you may know, I am the developer of the site &lt;a href=&#34;http://freshapps.com&#34;&gt;FreshApps.com&lt;/a&gt;. One thing we had been doing to make some extra money is to use &lt;a href=&#34;http://linkshare.com&#34;&gt;Linkshare&lt;/a&gt; to be an affiliate for Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t know, &lt;a href=&#34;http://linkshare.com&#34;&gt;Linkshare&lt;/a&gt; is a service that allows you to become an affiliate of thousands of companies. You simply select one of the companies products, get the linkshare link, and put the link on your site. Now, every time someone clicks that link and makes a purchase, you will get a percentage of the revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-problem&#34;&gt;The Problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only problem was, we have thousands of apps and converting the links manually seemed like such a daunting process. So, as you can imagine we converted around 10 links and never looked at it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, earlier today, the designer of the site &lt;a href=&#34;http://vanillahd.com&#34;&gt;JJ Mancini&lt;/a&gt;, asked me to check and see if linkshare had an API. I checked it out and sure enough, they did and it was no more complex than interfacing with a URL shortening service. So, I wrote the script and within minutes, all of our downloads links were converted into something that can now make us some revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-solution&#34;&gt;The Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I have created the script, I figured I would pretty it up and share it with you. Keep in mind, the script is stupid easy, so if I am insulting your intelligence by showing it, I apologize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;?php
    /\* linkshare.php \*/
 
    // Your linkshare API token
    $token = &amp;#34;89705XXXXd11ab28ae548bXXXX4ad6475279faXXXX65da0ec8ed77XXXXeb067&amp;#34;;
    // Apples Merchant ID
    $mid   = &amp;#34;13508&amp;#34;;
 
    $linkShareLinks = array();  
 
    // I assume links in an array of links to the app store
    foreach($links as $link) {
        $linkShareURL = &amp;#34;http://feed.linksynergy.com/createcustomlink.shtml?&amp;#34;.
            &amp;#34;token=$token∣=$mid&amp;amp;murl=$link&amp;amp;mt=8&amp;amp;buylink=yes&amp;#34;;

        if(stristr($linkShareReturn, &amp;#34;click.linksynergy.com&amp;#34;)) {
            array\_push($linkShareLinks,$linkShareReturn);
        } 
    }
 
    print\_r($linkShareLinks);
?&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;|&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s it! The variable $linkShareLinks will now contain all of the App Store links converted to your account’s linkshare url. If you have any site with that contains ads for apps in the app store (review site, developer blog, etc…), you would be crazy not to integrate with linkshare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give it a try, and feel free to ask questions in the comments section.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The culture of Digg is generally very liberal (to say the least). That is why I was very surprised to find one of the top stories of the day entitled ”&lt;a href=&#34;http://digg.com/people/Was_Jesus_a_real_person&#34;&gt;Was Jesus A Real Person?&lt;/a&gt;”. Obviously, the comments section of the article was full of people arguing about the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found the article to be quite well written and made a stellar case for the existence of Jesus. So whether you are a believer or not, you should check it out. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.y-jesus.com/bornid_1.php?gclid=CMfD2puS_Z0CFRUwpAodl1mgrw&#34;&gt;Take a look for yourself&lt;/a&gt; and let me know what you think.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Displaying Your FeedBurner Subscriber Count Anywhere &amp;#8211; PHP Coding Tutorial</title>
      <link>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2009/08/10/displaying-your-feedburner-subscriber-count-anywhere-php-coding-tutorial/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 10 Aug 2009 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate>
      <author>brandontreb@gmail.com (|ZeroCool|)</author><guid>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2009/08/10/displaying-your-feedburner-subscriber-count-anywhere-php-coding-tutorial/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://feedburner.com&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/uploads/2009/feedburner-logo1.png&#34; alt=&#34;feedburner-logo1&#34; title=&#34;feedburner-logo1&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a serious blogger (and I’m sure you are), you probably track your RSS subscribers with &lt;a href=&#34;http://feedburner.com&#34;&gt;FeedBurner&lt;/a&gt;. If you don’t, you should be. One thing that has always bugged me about FeedBurner is if you ever wanted to display the number of subscribers on your blog, you were stuck using their image. The image looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://feeds.feedburner.com/brandontreb&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/uploads/2009/brandontreb?bg=99ccff&amp;amp;fg=444444&amp;amp;anim=0&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure you have seen this logo everywhere. Well, not too many people know it, but FeedBurner actually has a very simple API that allows you to just get the subscriber count so you can display it however you would like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So rather than being limited to this boring icon, you can display your live subscriber count anywhere on your blog. If you are feeling adventurous, you could even super impose it on to your own custom image using the GD library (tutorial to come if sufficient interest, post in the comments if you would like to see it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s get started…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-activate-the-awareness-api-inside-of-feedburner&#34;&gt;1. Activate the Awareness API Inside Of Feedburner&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Log in to FeedBurner. Click the &lt;strong&gt;Publicize&lt;/strong&gt; tab and the click &lt;strong&gt;Awareness API&lt;/strong&gt;. Finally, click &lt;strong&gt;Activate&lt;/strong&gt;. The service is now enabled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/awareness_api.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/uploads/2009/awareness_api.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;awareness_api&#34; title=&#34;awareness_api&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-write-the-php-code-to-interface-with-feedburner&#34;&gt;2. Write The PHP Code To Interface With FeedBurner&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of data that you could potentially get from FeedBurner, but the code below will just show you how to get your &lt;strong&gt;subscriber count&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All you need to do is make a simple GET request using CURL to the URL &lt;a href=&#34;https://feedburner.google.com/api/awareness/1.0/GetFeedData?uri=brandontreb&#34;&gt;https://feedburner.google.com/api/awareness/1.0/GetFeedData?uri=brandontreb&lt;/a&gt; . Of course replacing &lt;strong&gt;brandontreb&lt;/strong&gt; with your feed’s name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;code class=’php’&amp;gt;&amp;lt;?php
$url = “&amp;lt;https://feedburner.google.com/api/awareness/1.0/GetFeedData?uri=brandontreb&amp;gt;”;
$ch = curl\_init();
curl\_setopt($ch, CURLOPT\_RETURNTRANSFER, 1);
curl\_setopt($ch, CURLOPT\_URL, $url);
$data = curl\_exec($ch);
curl\_close($ch);  

if ($data) {
echo $data;
preg\_match(‘/circulation=&amp;#34;([0-9]+)&amp;#34;/’,$data, $matches);
if ($matches[1](http://feedburner.com) != 0) {
$subscriberCount = $matches[1](http://feedburner.com);
}
}


echo “Join the other $subscriberCount people and subscriber to my RSS feed.”


?&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This code is pretty straight forward with a little trickiness to parse the XML. We first make a &lt;a href=&#34;http://us3.php.net/curl&#34;&gt;CURL&lt;/a&gt; connection to the URL. Just replace &lt;strong&gt;brandontreb&lt;/strong&gt; with the title of your RSS feed inside of FeedBurner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we print the data. Note: You won’t see the data in your browser unless you do a &lt;strong&gt;view source&lt;/strong&gt;. Since it is XML, your browser will treat it like HTML and not display it. So, we do a &lt;a href=&#34;http://us3.php.net/manual/en/function.preg-match.php&#34;&gt;preg_match&lt;/a&gt; for the element &lt;strong&gt;circulation&lt;/strong&gt; and get it’s value. (Pretty sick right?). The value of our &lt;strong&gt;subscriber count&lt;/strong&gt; will be at index 1 of the matches array.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, we just print the subscriber count and voila!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, you are no longer a slave to that generic FeedBurner subscriber count icon. Be sure to &lt;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/apis/feedburner/awareness_api.html&#34;&gt;check out their API&lt;/a&gt; for other cool things that you can do with their web services. If you have any questions, feel free to leave them in the comments section of this post. Happy Coding!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Easily Create And Manage SQLite Databases With A Firefox Plugin</title>
      <link>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2009/08/06/easily-create-and-manage-sqlite-databases-with-a-firefox-plugin/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 06 Aug 2009 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate>
      <author>brandontreb@gmail.com (|ZeroCool|)</author><guid>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2009/08/06/easily-create-and-manage-sqlite-databases-with-a-firefox-plugin/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are doing any Mac, iPhone, HTML5, etc… developement, you have probably had the need for an sqlite database. So, you fire up your Terminal and start manully typing commands to do CREATEs and INSERTs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You soon realize that this sucks and wish you had something like (&lt;em&gt;shudders&lt;/em&gt;) PHPMyAdmin to manage your database. Well, now you do and it’s actually a lot less hiddeous than PHPMyAdmin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/5817&#34;&gt;SQLite Manager plugin&lt;/a&gt; for Firefox, you can quickly CREATE, MODIFY, and DELETE sqlite databases visually. It’s very simple to use and makes the task of database creation a lot less painful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/5817&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/uploads/2009/sqlitemanager-500x375.png&#34; alt=&#34;sqlitemanager&#34; title=&#34;sqlitemanager&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here the description from the plugin site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manage any SQLite database on your computer. An intuitive heirarchical tree showing database objects. Helpful dialogs to manage tables, indexes, views and triggers. You can browse and search the tables, as well as add, edit, delete and duplicate the records. Facility to execute any sql query. The views can be searched too. A dropdown menu helps with the sql syntax thus making writing sql easier. Easy access to common operations through menu, toolbars, buttons and context-menu. Export tables/views/database in csv/xml/sql format. Import from csv/xml/sql (both UTF-8 and UTF-16). Possible to execute multiple sql statements in Execute tab. You can save the queries. Support for ADS on Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href=&#34;https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/5817&#34;&gt;download the SQLite Manager plugin for Firefox here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Installing And Deploying Rails On A Red Hat Server With Passenger</title>
      <link>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2009/07/23/installing-and-deploying-rails-on-a-red-hat-server-with-passenger/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 23 Jul 2009 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate>
      <author>brandontreb@gmail.com (|ZeroCool|)</author><guid>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2009/07/23/installing-and-deploying-rails-on-a-red-hat-server-with-passenger/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/rails1.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/uploads/2009/rails1-391x500.png&#34; alt=&#34;rails&#34; title=&#34;rails&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I have long been a fan of Ruby on Rails and even jumper on board very early on. The one thing that has held me back from using it in the majority of my projects is the fact that it’s such a pain to configure with Apache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know what you are saying… Just switch to a more Rails friendly server. I like and know Apache. Not to mention I also host PHP apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the (re)release of tagacloud, I have recently fell in love with ruby on rails again. So, I looked for a better solution for installation (last time I installed it was 3 years ago) and I stumbled upon &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.modrails.com/&#34;&gt;Passenger&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was super easy to use and had my running on Rails in no time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deployment is only a matter of uploading application files. No Ruby (on Rails)-specific server configuration required!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just to give you some background, here are some details about my server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OS:&lt;/strong&gt; Linux&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distribution:&lt;/strong&gt; Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 5.3 Hosted At Server Beach&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Control Panel:&lt;/strong&gt; Plesk 8.6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here are the steps I took to get Ruby on Rails up and running from scratch&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-install-ruby&#34;&gt;1. Install Ruby&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;code class=’bash’&amp;gt;yum install ruby ruby-libs ruby-mode ruby-rdoc ruby-irb ruby-ri ruby-docs&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will do some magic and install Ruby on your system…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-download-and-install-ruby-gems&#34;&gt;2. Download And Install Ruby Gems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Head on over to &lt;a href=&#34;http://rubygems.org/&#34;&gt;http://rubygems.org/&lt;/a&gt; and download the latest version of Ruby Gems. Here is an example of getting the latest version as of the posting date of this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;code class=’bash’&amp;gt;wget http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/60718/rubygems-1.3.5.tgz&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Untar this file…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;code class=’bash’&amp;gt;tar -xvf rubygems-1.3.5.tgz&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Navigate to the extracted directory and run the setup script&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;code class=’bash’&amp;gt;ruby setup.rb&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;3-install-rails&#34;&gt;3. Install Rails&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will install rails. If it asks you about dependencies, just type “Y”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;code class=’bash’&amp;gt;gem install rails&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;4-install-the-passenger-gem&#34;&gt;4. Install The Passenger Gem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that rails has been installed, we need to install &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.modrails.com/&#34;&gt;Passenger&lt;/a&gt;. The installation process is stupid simple. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.modrails.com/&#34;&gt;Passenger&lt;/a&gt; can be installed via a Ruby Gem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;code class=’bash’&amp;gt;gem install passenger&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, it will do some stuff and and you some questions. At some point in the process, it will check to see if you have all of the dependencies. &lt;strong&gt;You most likely will not&lt;/strong&gt;. Luckily, the geniuses who created Passenger tell you the commands to install all of the dependencies. So just follow the directions and you should be ok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;5-set-up-passenger-for-apache&#34;&gt;5. Set Up Passenger For Apache&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;code class=’bash’&amp;gt;passenger-install-apache2-module&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will ask you more questions and install everything needed to run Passenger. Pay attention to the stuff spit out at the end of the process. You will take this and paste it into your httpd.conf file. For example, here is the what mine spit out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;code class=’bash’&amp;gt;LoadModule passenger_module /usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/passenger-2.2.4/ext/apache2/mod_passenger.so
PassengerRoot /usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/passenger-2.2.4
PassengerRuby /usr/bin/ruby&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your &lt;strong&gt;httpd.conf&lt;/strong&gt; file is probably located at /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should now be good to go! Navigate to one of your vhosts folder (ex: tagacloud/httpdocs/) and create (or copy) a rails application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;code class=’bash’&amp;gt;rails someRailsApp&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then set permissions…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;code class=’bash’&amp;gt;chmod -R 755 someRailsApp&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then a miracle happens… and viola! You (should) have a fully functional up and running. Navigate to &lt;a href=&#34;http://domain.com/someRailsApp/public&#34;&gt;http://domain.com/someRailsApp/public&lt;/a&gt; to see your app in action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any comments or questions, feel free to leave them in the comments section of this post.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was a big fan of the game Alice that came out for PC. It def portrayed AIW as a darker sort of movie. It looks like Tim Burton will add a similar twist to the latest Alice In Wonderland Movie. Check out the trailer above.&lt;/p&gt;

      <author>brandontreb@gmail.com (|ZeroCool|)</author><guid>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2009/07/22/tagacloud-com-relaunched/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/tagAcloud-ad1.gif&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/uploads/2009/tagAcloud-ad1-500x188.gif&#34; alt=&#34;tagAcloud-ad&#34; title=&#34;tagAcloud-ad&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in 2006, my buddy JJ and I took some inspiration from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.milliondollarhomepage.com/&#34;&gt;Million Dollar Homepage&lt;/a&gt; and decided to create a totally inovative Web 2.0 site that works on the same principle. That is when we came up with the idea for &lt;a href=&#34;http://tagacloud.com&#34;&gt;tagacloud.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tagacloud is a simple concept that uses the fact that people are obsessed with stats to make a fun game that will also direct traffic to your site. Here is how it works (from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.tagacloud.com/help/instructions&#34;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;)…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-idea&#34;&gt;The Idea:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TagACloud is a very unique idea for a website, thus it will take a little explaining to understand all the facets. To take full advantage of the site, you must be the owner or have control over your own website. The idea is to create a tag that represents your website. A tag is a descriptive phrase or a creative tagline describing your site. Once you have added your tag, it gets added to the Tag Cloud. This is where all the fun begins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-goal&#34;&gt;The Goal:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal is simple. Become the biggest freakin’ tag on the TagACloud website. The bigger the tag, the more hits it gets. It is that simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-your-tag-gets-bigger&#34;&gt;How Your Tag Gets Bigger:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your tag gets bigger every time it levels up! And the only way to get your tag to level up is by accumulating points. Points can be acquired in many different ways, but the two primary ways to acquire points are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get Clicked: your tag gets 1 point for every click that your tag receives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incoming Hits: your tag gets 2 points for every hit you send to your tag on &lt;a href=&#34;http://TagACloud.com&#34;&gt;TagACloud.com&lt;/a&gt;. You can get tag specific code via your “Get Tag Code” page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-your-tag-gets-hits&#34;&gt;How Your Tag Gets Hits&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We provide visitors several ways to find your tag:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Home Page: The home page features 200 random tags in random order.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Popular Tags: If your tag is one of the 200 most popular today, the last 7 days, last month, or of all time; it will be featured in order of popularity on the applicable page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keywords: Keywords are essential for any tag that wants to generate hits. Keywords are like user defined categories. We combine all the tags that share common keywords. For example, &lt;a href=&#34;http://google.com&#34;&gt;google.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://yahoo.com&#34;&gt;yahoo.com&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://vanillasasquatch.com&#34;&gt;vanillasasquatch.com&lt;/a&gt; would all share the keyword, SearchEngine. Each tag can have up to 3 keywords associated with it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Randomizer: The title says it all. A user can view a random tag’s website, or view a random keyword.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;statistics&#34;&gt;Statistics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 3 big addictions on the web. Without sharing the top 2, we will let you know #3, is statistics. People love to view the stats on anything and everything. Here at TagACloud, we will make sure not to disappoint. You will be able to view statistics for every little thing, to ensure that you always know the current state of your tag. You will also find the website itself is littered with stats. Just keep your eyes open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;../wp-content/uploads/2009/07/tagacloud.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/uploads/2009/tagacloud.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;tagacloud&#34; title=&#34;tagacloud&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of late 2007, Tagacloud was booming with over &lt;strong&gt;10,000 users&lt;/strong&gt;. Then, one day JJ and I decided we would take a weekend and “improve” tagacloud. Now, if any of you are programmers, you know “improving” an app takes much longer than you anticipate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We set out to do it in a weekend and the ideas started flowing. It was Facebook meets Halo 3 meets Digg meets Hannah Montanna meets Karate Kid 3… And then the weekend ended and Tagacloud would remain a “Coming Soon” page for a year and a half… &lt;img src=&#34;https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/uploads/2009/frownie.png&#34; alt=&#34;:(&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago, JJ and I were sitting around and thought to ourselves “Why did we ever take down the old tagacloud?”. One thing led to another and we decided to completely wipe the database and start tagacloud fresh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, go fourth and start &lt;a href=&#34;http://tagacloud.com&#34;&gt;leveling your tag&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <author>brandontreb@gmail.com (|ZeroCool|)</author><guid>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2009/06/08/iphonelb-com-gets-a-much-needed-update/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/screenshot_04.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/uploads/2009/screenshot_04.png&#34; alt=&#34;screenshot_04&#34; title=&#34;screenshot_04&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I started this site called &lt;a href=&#34;http://iphonelb.com&#34;&gt;iphonelb.com&lt;/a&gt; a few months back and left out a very important feature. The ability to edit your applications!?! What this means is, users have been testing their apps and putting in “test data” and when it comes time for release, the can’t modify it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another feature missing, was the ability to clean out all of your test scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, thanks to about 8 minutes of my time, this has been resolved and the feature has been added. I am really excited about iphonelb and have some big things planned for it in the future. &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/brandontreb&#34;&gt;Write me on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; or on my blog if you have any feature requests for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After seeing the show Parks and Recreation last night, I have come to the conclusion that the show is doomed to fail. Not only is it not funny, it’s jokes try to mimic the dry awkward humor of The Office. Parks and Recreation Fail!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Increasing Your Blog Traffic Using Twitter Trends</title>
      <link>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2009/04/06/increasing-your-blog-traffic-using-twitter-trends/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 06 Apr 2009 00:00:00 -0600</pubDate>
      <author>brandontreb@gmail.com (|ZeroCool|)</author><guid>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2009/04/06/increasing-your-blog-traffic-using-twitter-trends/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/twitter_trends.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/uploads/2009/twitter_trends.png&#34; alt=&#34;twitter_trends&#34; title=&#34;twitter_trends&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter Trends are a very interesting part of Twitter. They are basically the most typed keywords or &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.pbwiki.com/Hashtags&#34;&gt;hashtags&lt;/a&gt; on twitter for a given day. Some examples might be &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/timeline/search?q=%23musicmonday&amp;amp;source=sidebar&amp;amp;category=trends&#34;&gt;#musicmonday&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/timeline/search?q=MacHeist&amp;amp;source=sidebar&amp;amp;category=trends&#34;&gt;macHeist&lt;/a&gt;. These are fun and all but how can you use them to get traffic to my website/blog…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;find-trends-that-refer-to-articles-people-are-linking-to&#34;&gt;Find Trends That Refer To Articles People Are Linking To?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, often times trends refer to words associated with website articles, videos, images, etc… For example, the other day, the word mashable was trending on Twitter. This was because &lt;a href=&#34;http://Mashable.com&#34;&gt;Mashable.com&lt;/a&gt; had just put out an &lt;a href=&#34;http://mashable.com/2009/04/04/twitter-trends/&#34;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; on twitter trends. Since people were talking about and more importantly &lt;strong&gt;linking to&lt;/strong&gt; this article, the word mashtable was trending…Naturally, this article got quite a bit of traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;post-a-comment-on-the-article&#34;&gt;Post a Comment On The Article&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I commented on the article leaving a link to my blog. That day, I got ~50 extra uniques to my blog! You can do the same by closely following the trends. Make sure you read the article and are not just spamming the comments section. Many articles use blog systems (such as WordPress) that allow you to link to your website/blog in your commentsl. Post a comment that contributes to the discussion and I guaruntee it will generate more traffic to your website/blog. Again, don’t be a spammer, contribute something to the discussion…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;be-prompt-comment-early&#34;&gt;Be Prompt (comment early)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sooner you comment on the article, the more traffic it will generate to your site. In the above example, I was like the 15th or 16th to commenter. Imagine if I had been the first…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this method isn’t perfect, it’s a sure fire way to generate some quick traffic for your blog/website. Do this every day, and you could be huge!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a blog/website then you probably have heard of &lt;a href=&#34;http://alexa.com&#34;&gt;Alexa&lt;/a&gt;. If not, you should search your blog in it to find out some interesting stats. Being a stat junkie, I check services like this frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears that Alexa has recently updated their interface from their old jenk &lt;strong&gt;web .05&lt;/strong&gt; hideousness. While it’s not quite &lt;strong&gt;web 2.0&lt;/strong&gt;, I’d say it has a good start as web 1.6 (maybe 1.7 because of the shine on the logo).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a side note, icodeblog seems to be huge in Canada 😉&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ok, so I am sure you have seen this video by now, but I just had to post it because it’s flippin hilarious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This perfectly describes mine (and others) Twitter obsession. Kinda sad actually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I depend on Google way too much for spell checking, simple math, and looking up things I don’t know off the top of my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s sad because often my first instinct when handwriting something or even looking for a lost object in my house is to “Google it”.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, after downloading many iPhone games and talking with a ton of iphone developers, I have a found a huge need in the community. Over the next week I will be developing a killer web application with a web service API that will be free to iPhone developers to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not going to give out any details at the moment, but be sure to subscribe to my RSS feed as I will be blogging about it through out next week (Spring Break = Time to develop). It should be completed by late next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guarantee, if you are an iPhone game developer, you will benefit tremendously from what I am about to release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excited? So am I…&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Only Twitter API PHP Class You Will Ever Need</title>
      <link>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2009/02/27/the-only-twitter-api-php-class-you-will-ever-need/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 27 Feb 2009 01:00:00 -0600</pubDate>
      <author>brandontreb@gmail.com (|ZeroCool|)</author><guid>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2009/02/27/the-only-twitter-api-php-class-you-will-ever-need/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/twit.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/uploads/2009/twit.png&#34; alt=&#34;twit&#34; title=&#34;twit&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Twitter has switchted their entire interface to use OAUTH and this class no longer works (I should probably change the title hahaha). I will post an oauth connection tutorial in the near future, so make sure to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://feeds2.feedburner.com/brandontreb&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;subscribe to my RSS feed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for all of the sweet sweets updates!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cheers!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I started writing a Twitter API Programming series last week… &lt;a href=&#34;http://brandontreb.com/twitter-api-programming-tutorial-with-php-getting-started/&#34;&gt;Here is part 1&lt;/a&gt;. I have found that there is not much else to teach when it comes to interfacing with Twitter. Basically, we just need to implement all of the Twitter functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have taken it upon myself to create a fully functional &lt;strong&gt;Twitter API PHP class&lt;/strong&gt;. It has every Twitter function you will ever need (less the direct messages). I have also fully documented it with comments directly from the Twitter API so that the functions are easy to understand. Here is how you would use the class. The first parameter of every function is the return type. For Twitter it can be either xml, json, or rss for some functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;code class=’php’&amp;gt;include(&amp;#34;Twitter.class.php&amp;#34;);
    $twitter = new Twitter();
    $twitter-&amp;gt;username = &amp;#34;twitteruser&amp;#34;;
    $twitter-&amp;gt;password = &amp;#34;twitterpass&amp;#34;;
    // Show public timeline
    echo $twitter-&amp;gt;public_timeline();
    // Update your status
    echo $twitter-&amp;gt;update(‘xml’,’This PHP class is flippin sweet!’);
    // Start following a user
    echo $twitter-&amp;gt;create(‘xml’,’brandontreb’);&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are just 3 of the functions implemented in this class. The full function list includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;public_timeline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;friends_timeline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;user_timeline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;update&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;replies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;friends&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;followers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;show&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;destroy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;exists&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these functions are fully documented and simple to use. You can also check out Twitter’s API &lt;a href=&#34;http://apiwiki.twitter.com/REST+API+Documentation&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (but you shouldn’t need to).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, now you can fully **integrate Twitter into any PHP application you create! **&lt;/p&gt;

      <author>brandontreb@gmail.com (|ZeroCool|)</author><guid>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2009/02/20/twitter-api-programming-tutorial-with-php-intro/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/picture-15.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/uploads/2009/picture-15.png&#34; alt=&#34;picture-15&#34; title=&#34;&amp;amp;uuot;picture-15&amp;quot;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have recently started using Twitter and completely fell in love with it. Being a programming, this naturally made me want to develop applications for interfacing with it. So, I scoured the internet (checking Twitter’s website as well) to find good *simple tutorials for doing this. After searching for a while, I couldn’t really find any. Ok, I lied, I found a few but they were terrible. I hate tutorials that assume the reader knows more than they actually do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I am taking it upon myself to write a series of comprehensive tutorials for interfacing with Twitter. I will first do them all in PHP and then maybe in some other languages. I may even do some in Objective-C to be implemented on the iPhone. These would be written of course at &lt;a href=&#34;http://iCodeBlog.com&#34;&gt;iCodeBlog.com&lt;/a&gt; 😉 .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s just jump right in. Twitter offers a few ways to interface with their web services, which are all documented on their &lt;a href=&#34;http://apiwiki.twitter.com/&#34;&gt;API Wiki&lt;/a&gt;. The documentation is great, assuming you know the code to get connected and make the calls. So, let’s skip all of the nerdy low level stuff and write an application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I will be teaching you how to simply connect to Twitter and update your status. This will be pretty straight forward and require very little PHP code. So, grab some coffee, open up your favorite PHP editor (notepad?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so let’s start by wrapping our code into an easy to call function. We don’t want to have to copy and paste our Twitter interface code every time we need it in a project. Wouldn’t it be nice if we could just call it like this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;code class=’php’&amp;gt;updateTwitter(&amp;#34;Just Rockin Out&amp;#34;)&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;So let’s begin by declaring a function called &lt;strong&gt;updateTwitter&lt;/strong&gt;. Type the following code&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;code class=’php’&amp;gt;function updateTwitter($status){ 
    // Twitter login information 
    $username = &amp;#34;TwitterUsername&amp;#34;; 
    $password = &amp;#34;TwitterPassword&amp;#34;;&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our function begins with a declaration of a username and password. This will be &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; Twitter login information. Every Twitter API call requires that you authenticate yourself. Make sure you update the code to include &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; username and password/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we will add the following code to initialize the variables needed to make our Twitter API call. Continue by adding the following code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;code class=’php’&amp;gt;// The url of the update function 
    $url = ‘http://twitter.com/statuses/update.xml’; 
    // Arguments we are posting to Twitter 
    $postargs = ‘status=’.urlencode($status); 
    // Will store the response we get from Twitter 
    $responseInfo=array(); 
    // Initialize CURL 
    $ch = curl_init($url);&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing I want to point out is the URL. Notice the update.xml at the end of it. This is telling the Twitter API we want to call the &lt;strong&gt;update&lt;/strong&gt; function and we expect to receive &lt;strong&gt;xml&lt;/strong&gt; back. You could also change it to be &lt;strong&gt;update.json&lt;/strong&gt; if you want to receive json data back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next variable &lt;strong&gt;postargs&lt;/strong&gt; is simply the arguments we will pass to the update function. Since these arguments get appended to the URL, they need to be urlencoded. The &lt;strong&gt;responseInfo&lt;/strong&gt; array will contain the return data from the cURL request to Twitter. Finally, we just initialize a new cURL session. cURL is just a protocol for transferring data. You can read up on it &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL&#34;&gt;on Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; if you feel so inclined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we need to tell cURL to do a POST rather than a GET and pass it our argument string&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;code class=’php’&amp;gt;// Tell CURL we are doing a POST 
    curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_POST, true); 
    // Give CURL the arguments in the POST 
    curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $postargs);&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next part is where the magic happens. Here is the next bit of code (I’ll explain it below)…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;code class=’php’&amp;gt;// Set the username and password in the CURL call 
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_USERPWD, $username.’:’.$password); 
    // Set some cur flags (not too important) 
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_VERBOSE, 1); 
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_NOBODY, 0); 
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HEADER, 0); 
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION,1); 
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1); 
    // execute the CURL call 
    $response = curl_exec($ch); 
    // Get information about the response 
    $responseInfo=curl_getinfo($ch); 
    // Close the CURL connection curl_close($ch);&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wow! that looks like a lot of nerdy code. Good thing you only have to write it once and don’t have to understand it (unless you want to). The first line sets the username and password fields in our cURL call. When we first connect with the Twitter API, it will prompt for a username and password. cURL will automatically feed the username and password to the API.  The next few lines are not super important. If you one of those people that get hung up on that sort of thing, you can read about them &lt;a href=&#34;http://us.php.net/curl&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. We’re almost done, I promise… Finally, we make the cURL call itself by calling curl_exec. This will return a response &lt;strong&gt;from Twitter&lt;/strong&gt; which will contains some XML if your call completed successfully. The next line, gets the http response (makes sure you were able to connect to Twitter). If it is anything other than 200 (HTTP OK), it means your cURL request never even reached Twitter. Here is the last bit of code&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;code class=’php’&amp;gt;// Make sure we received a response from Twitter 
    if(intval($responseInfo[‘http_code’])==200){ 
        // Display the response from Twitter 
        echo $response; 
    }else{ 
        // Something went wrong 
        echo &amp;#34;Error: &amp;#34; . $responseInfo[‘http_code’]; 
    } 
} 
?&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;All this code really does is makes sure we got a 200 code (successfully reached Twitter). If so, it prints out the XML that Twitter returned to us.  Now you have a handy-dandy function you can call whenever we want to update your Twitter status from your website. Simply type&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;code class=’php’&amp;gt;updateTwitter(&amp;#34;Just finished a sweet tutorial on http://brandontreb.com&amp;#34;)&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;and like magic, your Twitter status will be updated. This has many different uses as you can imagine. Join me next time when I will be putting this code into a PHP class as well as implementing the rest of the Twitter API functions. We will then be able to use this Twitter class in a variety of PHP applications. So , be sure to &lt;a href=&#34;http://feeds2.feedburner.com/brandontreb&#34;&gt;subscribe to my RSS feed&lt;/a&gt; and feel free to ask me any questions in the comments section of this post.

      <title>Blogging Practices &amp;#8211; Frequency and Size of Posts</title>
      <link>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2009/02/18/blogging-practices-frequency-and-size-of-posts/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2009 01:00:00 -0600</pubDate>
      <author>brandontreb@gmail.com (|ZeroCool|)</author><guid>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2009/02/18/blogging-practices-frequency-and-size-of-posts/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you have ever had your own blog, you may have at one point been faced with a question. How often should I write a blog post and how long should each post be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been thinking about this since I started blogging. It is a common thought that you must write a post every single day in order to increase/maintain traffic. But, is this really true? For busy people with families and lives (that aren’t blogging) might have a tough time writing a new content-rich post every single day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, would readers rather see less frequent but “better” blog posts or more frequent “weaker” blog posts? Or maybe even a combo of the two?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, what if between killer programming tutorials, I wrote short posts about my dog or response to popular articles. Would this benefit my readers or turn them off?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t have a real solution to this but plan to employ some of these strategies while writing this blog. Hopefully, I will be able to draw some conclusions and share them. If you happen to stumble on this post on your journey through the interwebz, please feel free to comment and shed some light on this for me.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Buzzword</title>
      <link>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2009/02/17/buzzword/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2009 01:00:00 -0600</pubDate>
      <author>brandontreb@gmail.com (|ZeroCool|)</author><guid>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2009/02/17/buzzword/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/uploads/2009/buzzword_iphone.png&#34; alt=&#34;buzzword_iphone&#34; title=&#34;buzzword_iphone&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-ultimate-party-game-has-arrived-in-the-app-store-if-you-are-a-fan-of-the-game-catch-phrase-then-you-will-love-buzzword&#34;&gt;The ultimate party game has arrived in the App Store! If you are a fan of the game Catch-Phrase, then you will love Buzzword.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this fast-paced game, do whatever it takes to get your team to guess the word or phrase. Give them clues – talk, use your hands, jump around. Once they guess, pass it quick. You don’t want to be caught with the game at the buzz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;game-controls&#34;&gt;Game Controls:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start/Stop&lt;/strong&gt; – Starts and stops the timer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Category **– Selects a category&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team1&lt;/strong&gt; – Awards a point to team 1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team 2&lt;/strong&gt; – Awards a point to team 2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Next **– Selects the next word to describe&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;game-rules&#34;&gt;Game Rules:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To play the game, players need to split up into two teams. You should sit in a circle alternating every other person as a member on your team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the teams will need to decide on a category in which the words will come from. This is done by pressing the “Category” button. Next, pick a team to begin the game with the first word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game starts by pressing the “start/stop” button to start the timer. The player holding the iPhone/iPod will try to describe the word on the screen. They can say and do whatever they want without saying any of the words on the screen, saying “rhymes with”, or saying “starts with”. All of the members on their team will then try to guess the word or phrase the player is trying to describe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the word has been guessed, the iPhone/iPod is passed to the next player on the opposite team. This player will press the “Next” button to receive a new word to describe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game is played until the buzzer goes off. At this point, the team NOT holding the iPhone/iPod gets a point. This is done by pressing either the “Team 1” or “Team 2” buttons. The first team to 7 wins!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Connect Facebook To Twitter</title>
      <link>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2009/02/17/how-to-connect-facebook-to-twitter/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2009 01:00:00 -0600</pubDate>
      <author>brandontreb@gmail.com (|ZeroCool|)</author><guid>https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/2009/02/17/how-to-connect-facebook-to-twitter/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the growing popularity of both Twitter and Facebook, one could obviously see a need to link them together. Whether you primarily use Twitter or Facebook, this tutorial will show you step by step, how to update your Facebook status by posting to your Twitter account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how can you update your Facebook status with a text message? Well, Twitter offers this great functionality that allows you to post a “Tweet” via text message. If you combine this with the Twitter app that Facebook offers, you can now update your Facebook and Twitter status simultaneously with one text message (no internet required).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you will need:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/&#34;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; Account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://facebook.com&#34;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; Account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cell Phone Capable of Sending Text Messages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;signing-up-for-twitter&#34;&gt;Signing Up For Twitter&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step is to sign up for a Twitter account if you don’t already have one. Head on over to &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/signup&#34;&gt;http://twitter.com/signup&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/signup&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/uploads/2009/picture-11.png&#34; alt=&#34;Twitter&#34; title=&#34;Twitter&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;setting-up-text-message-updates-on-twitter&#34;&gt;Setting Up Text Message Updates On Twitter&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You first need to tell Twitter that you want to post from your phone. Start by clicking on &lt;strong&gt;Settings&lt;/strong&gt; in the top right corner of your Twitter page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/uploads/2009/picture-2.png&#34; alt=&#34;Settings&#34; title=&#34;Settings&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, select the &lt;strong&gt;Devices&lt;/strong&gt; tab&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/uploads/2009/picture-13.png&#34; alt=&#34;picture-13&#34; title=&#34;picture-13&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter in your phone number with a “+” in front of it, followed by the country code. So for US phone numbers, it’s +1… Look at the image below for an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/uploads/2009/picture-3.png&#34; alt=&#34;picture-3&#34; title=&#34;picture-3&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter will then send your phone a text message containing a unique code. Once you get it, enter it in the box. Now you are able to update your Twitter status by sending a text message to &lt;strong&gt;40404&lt;/strong&gt;. Whatever you send to this number will be posted to Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;connecting-facebook-to-twitter&#34;&gt;Connecting Facebook to Twitter&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, you simply need to install the Twitter application on your Facebook account. Log in to Facebook and go to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?sid=c23a2e7431ca430d5a5ffe3b1008192e&amp;amp;id=2231777543&amp;amp;ref=s&#34;&gt;Twitter’s application&lt;/a&gt;. You can find it by &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?sid=c23a2e7431ca430d5a5ffe3b1008192e&amp;amp;id=2231777543&amp;amp;ref=s&#34;&gt;clicking here&lt;/a&gt; or searching for “Twitter” in the search bar. Once on Twitter’s page click “Go to Application”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/picture-14.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/uploads/2009/picture-14.png&#34; alt=&#34;picture-14&#34; title=&#34;picture-14&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will ask you if you want to allow access to the Twitter application on Facebook. Click “Allow”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/picture-31.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/uploads/2009/picture-31-300x168.png&#34; alt=&#34;picture-31&#34; title=&#34;picture-31&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it will ask you to enter your Twitter user name and password. Enter it in and click “Log In”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/picture-4.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/uploads/2009/picture-4-300x107.png&#34; alt=&#34;picture-4&#34; title=&#34;picture-4&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, click on “Allow Twitter To Update Your Facebook Status”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/picture-5.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://brandontreb.ngrok.io/uploads/2009/picture-5-300x47.png&#34; alt=&#34;picture-5&#34; title=&#34;picture-5&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next screen will confirm. Click “Allow” and you are good to go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There you have it! It sounds a little complicated, but trust me, updating your Facebook status via text message is very handy. You don’t even have to look at your Twitter account every again (although you should because Twitter is rad). If you have any questions or comments, feel free to leave them in the comments section of this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/share&#34;&gt;Tweet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this blog will be primarily to share my programming knowledge through coding tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be writing tutorials based on the programming language that I am currently excited about. These will be anywhere from objective-c to ruby on rails to .NET. Whatever strikes my fancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the road, I will also be sharing my art (photo and drawing) as well as anything else I find interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So just sit back and enjoy the magic of code!&lt;/p&gt;
