      <description>Since seeing a bobcat in The Bosque a few months ago, I now am constantly looking over my shoulder while I‚Äôm out there on my runs.
It‚Äôs both exciting and terrifying. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</description>

      <description>I switched from weight lifting to calisthenics in the gym over a year ago. It was one of the best decisions ever.
A year in, and I still get excited to go every single time.
It feels like I‚Äôm a kid again getting to play on the playground at recess. ü§∏</description>

      <description>Well, I have finally decided to put my money where my mouth is when it comes to fitness and train up for a half marathon! The marathon I‚Äôm training for is the Albuquerque Half Marathon on Saturday, April 16th at 8 am (that logo is such an eyesore).
Two months seems like a relatively short time to prepare, especially for my first ‚Äúreal‚Äù run, however I am just aiming to finish rather than being competitive.</description>

      <description>For this blog post, I decided to take a small break from my Twitter Client for Mac tutorial series and discuss something a little more useful üòâ . I felt that a fitness post would be most appropriate around this time of year as all of our ‚ÄúGeek Guts‚Äù begin expanding.
My Fitness Story It‚Äôs December 23rd and as we gear up for Christmas, we are also compiling our New Year‚Äôs resolutions.</description>

Check out this recent study that was discussed on the New York Times. When you use an exercise ball for a chair, you are constantly repositioning yourself and are combatting this issue.
