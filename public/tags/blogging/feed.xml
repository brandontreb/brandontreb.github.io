      <description>No, Blogging Is Not Dying Anytime Soon - Darius Foroux
But still, people who read have always been in the minority. And I think that’s what most people who think that “video is the future” don’t get. Sure, people are getting lazier and they want you to feed them content.
But think about it. Do you really want to serve those types of people?!
I love “Blogging Is Not Dead” posts because I love to blog and often wonder if it’s a waste of time.</description>

      <description>I wrote my very first blog post back in July of 2008 when I start iCodeBlog.com. I started the blog because I saw a huge need for iOS development tutorials on the web and really wanted to help others as I progressed in my development.
Well, quite a bit has changed since then. I have written books, spoken at conferences, and built and shipped over 40 iOS applications. Since selling iCodeblog in 2009, I have really let my passion for blogging fizzle.</description>
