      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31135972&#34;&gt;Apple says they&amp;rsquo;re removing my game because it&amp;rsquo;s more than 2 years old&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This HN thread really resonated with me. I have been building and publishing iOS apps since the dawn of the App Store in 2008. In those 14 years, I have shipped over 200 apps, and do you want to know how many are still in the App Store? &lt;strong&gt;Zero&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these takedowns are due to startups failing or clients deciding to go in another direction, but still quite a few are forced out due to Apple’s update policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a strange feeling knowing that everything I have built for the past decade and a half has just disappeared into obsolescence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I understand that Apple needs to continue to push their techbology forward, I would at least love to see them keep apps for posterity, albeit not searchable. This could satisfy their algorithmic search goals while still allowing developers to preserve their history.&lt;/p&gt;
