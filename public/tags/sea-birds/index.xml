      <description>Introduction Loud, screeching, ravenous and aggressive. For many, this is the perception of seagulls - simply an annoyance.
But many people don&amp;rsquo;t realise the plight of these seabirds, which are in decline or heavily endangered. Being a cute and cuddly looking kakapo, critically endangered and loved by all, makes conservation efforts and public opinion trivial. But how do we get people to respect something that looks severe and is aggressive? This is a great dilemma for the much maligned gull as they, like all seabirds, play an important role in their environments and are worthy of conservation efforts, even if we don&amp;rsquo;t appreciate their behaviour.</description>
