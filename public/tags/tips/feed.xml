      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I first started out as an independent software developer, one of things that stressed me out the most was how to structure contracts that I sent to clients. Â Working for a consultancy in my previous work-life I had seen contracts before, however, I never really paid enough attention to them to know what type of content went into them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After quite a bit of research, I found an invaluable resource. Â Over at &lt;a href=&#34;http://techrepublic.com&#34;&gt;techrepublic.com&lt;/a&gt;, Chip Camden posted a beautifully crafted consulting contract template. Â You can see the post and download the template &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/it-consultant/customizable-it-consultant-sample-contract/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Â This post was a lifesaver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chip goes over EVERY single section of the contract and gives an explanation of why itâ€™s there. Â You can download the template and determine which sections you need for your business, based on his explanations. Â It doesnâ€™t get much easier than that. Â Of course, I would still strongly suggest you fork over a couple hundred bucks and have a lawyer look over the contract before sending it off to clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;how-to-sign-contracts-online&#34;&gt;How To Sign Contracts Online&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have your contract in place, you will need a way to get your clients to sign it. Â You could go the old-fashioned way of scanning, both parties signing, and scanning again OR you could use an online signature service. Â One that I use and highly recommend is &lt;a href=&#34;https://rightsignature.com&#34;&gt;RightSignature&lt;/a&gt;. I know those guys personally and have had a great experience with the service so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;here-is-my-process&#34;&gt;Here is my process:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what I have found works out well for my business. Â #proTip: I have my assistant do this now ðŸ˜‰&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complete the contract blanks in regards to rates or any other information you want the client to see before they sign the contract.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upload the contract template to Google Drive (optional). Â Make sure your company info is completed and all of the other fields (dates, signatures, etcâ€¦) are blanked out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once inside of your RightSignature account, you can connect to your Google Drive and import the document in. Â You can also upload them directly from your computer if you donâ€™t want to use Google Drive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RightSignature lets you put text fields and date boxes in the blanks and specify who is responsible for filling them out (you or the client).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, add the signature fields at the bottom and send off the document for signing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once every party has filled out the needed information, the completed document is then sent to both parties via email.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;other-considerations&#34;&gt;Other Considerations&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often times, the client will have their own contracts for you to sign. Â This isnâ€™t necessarily a bad thing. Â However, make sure that you read over it carefully and run it by your lawyer. Â Donâ€™t try to force your contract on a client that already has their own. Â They will usually not be open to this, in my experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure to have an â€˜exit clauseâ€™ in your contract in case things go sour. Â I seldom enter into fixed bid contracts so I usually have a clause where either party can cancel the contract with 7 days written notice. Â This also makes the client feel at ease as they are not trapped with you in an event where their situation changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, be willing to be flexible. Â Sometimes clients might not like certain clauses in your contract. Â Be willing to change things like delivery dates, invoice dates, invoice periods, rates, etcâ€¦ on a client to client basis. Â Obviously, use your best judgement here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that you have found this post useful and it saves you some time hunting down a contract template. Â I am always open to suggestions so if you see anything else that works for you, I would love to hear about it via email or in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer and do not claim to be giving any real legal advice. Â I am simply stating how I do things with my business. Â Make sure to consult with a lawyer before engaging in any contracts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
