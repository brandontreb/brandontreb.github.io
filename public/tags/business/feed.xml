      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s late, you have been hacking all night to get the client a build. Finally, around 2:30 am, you hit submit and publish something to the client and go to bed. When you wake up in the morning, the first thing you see in your inbox is an email titled &amp;ldquo;Completely Broken!!1!&amp;rdquo;.
How could this be? You stayed up late, you hacked, you tested and you sweat over this build to find that it crashes for the client when they try to do something obvious.</description>

      <description>There is a familiar phrase that I hear all too often when a client comes to me with an existing application. It goes something like this:
“Our team spent quite a bit of money on our application and we don’t want to ship it. We are not proud of the product.”
It blows my mind that many developers and development teams are still in business given the poor quality of products that I see getting churned out all of the time.</description>
