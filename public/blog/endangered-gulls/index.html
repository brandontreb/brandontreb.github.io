    <h1>Endangered Gulls</h1>
  </header>
  <section class="post-content"><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Loud, screeching, ravenous and aggressive. For many, this is the perception of seagulls - simply an annoyance.</p>
<p>But many people don&rsquo;t realise the plight of these seabirds, which are in decline or heavily endangered. Being a cute and cuddly looking kakapo, critically endangered and loved by all, makes conservation efforts and public opinion trivial. But how do we get people to respect something that looks severe and is aggressive? This is a great dilemma for the much maligned gull as they, like all seabirds, play an important role in their environments and are worthy of conservation efforts, even if we don&rsquo;t appreciate their behaviour.</p>
<h2 id="quick-facts">Quick facts</h2>
<p>The tarapunga/red-billed gull has a population of around 500,000, although this seemingly high number is only the result of strong conservation efforts. In previous decades, these gulls had been under huge threat of invasive predators and close to facing extinction. But even now, they aren&rsquo;t out of the (drift)woods yet, with climate pressures and difficulty with predators still issues that could cause populations to plummit.</p>
<p>The tarapuka/black-billed gull, a lesser seen seabird, is even worse off. It has the unfortunate status of being one of the most threatened gulls in the world, with a population of only about 60,000. Although more common around rivers and much quieter, they look quite similar to their &ldquo;pesky&rdquo; red-billed relatives. This doesn&rsquo;t help people recognise them as different and in desperate need of help.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Even though many think of gulls as a nuisance, it&rsquo;s worth keeping in mind how fragile their populations are, and how far conservation efforts have already come. They are also vital members of their environments, so maybe we should think twice before considering them useless pests.</p>
