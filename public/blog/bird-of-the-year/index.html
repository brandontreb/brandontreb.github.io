<p>Here in Aotearoa/New Zealand, we love our unique wildlife. In fact, most of it consists of birds, with no natural predators existing until European settlement. Unfortunately, many of these wonderful creatures had evolved - often in strange ways - to manage without the pressures of predators. This has led to many flightless birds, and a number of others with high curiosity, which has made them easy prey for newly introduced predators.</p>
<p>As a way of celebrating their diversity, as well as creating awareness of how threatened many are, the <a href="https://www.birdoftheyear.org.nz/">Bird of the Year</a> competition has been run since 2005 by our largest independent conservation organisation, <a href="https://www.forestandbird.org.nz/">Forest and Bird</a>. This has since become an important event each year, especially on social media, and known globally. Depending on the year, it might even rival the general elections (government) in popularity.</p>
