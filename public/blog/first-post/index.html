<p>CawCannon is all about bringing you the latest information on the birds, conservation efforts, and other caws for concern in Aotearoa - the Land of the Long White Cloud.</p>
<p>Here in Aotearoa/New Zealand, we love our unusual wildlife and nature. What makes it especially unusual is that that there are essentially zero dangerous creatures or native predators. Due to separation from other continents and isolation, our flora and fauna have developed in some unique and interesting ways that hark back to life in Gondwanaland.</p>
<p>Our dense, primeval forests are teeming with life, and most of the larger animals are actually birds - no foxes, wolves, or other large predators. Without these pressures, many of our avian friends have given up the need for flight. A number are also quite curious, mischievous and highly social, with little fear of humans due to this lack of predators.</p>
<p>As you can expect, this hasn&rsquo;t worked out the best for much of the native fauna, as introduced species quickly took advantage of easy-to-reach eggs and prey.</p>
<p>However, early on we recognised how much our wildlife and nature are threatened by our activity, and numerous conservation campaigns have been implemented to keep these unique and endangered animals alive - even if almost no-one gets to see them face to face.</p>
<p>We hope you&rsquo;ll enjoy our site and regular updates.</p>
<p>Regards, the CawCannon team</p>
