  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p>Recently, I was pretty humbled when a post of mine titled <a href="http://brandontreb.com/wordpress-to-jekyll-and-back-again/">WordPress To Jekyll And Back Again</a> made it to the front page of Hacker News. I was a little down on Jekyll for the reasons listed in that post and was feeling pretty good about my WordPress install.</p>
<p>At the time, I was running my own virtual instance on Rackspace cloud hosting (we‚Äôll get to this momentarily). I also had all of the caching and optimization plugins installed and welcomed the Hacker News traffic.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, the influx of HN traffic crashed the server multiple times and I was (with good reason) mocked in the comments (‚Äúmust be because he‚Äôs ‚Äòback to WordPress‚Äô‚Äù). So, I asked for advice and further ‚Äúbeefed up‚Äù my setup switching from Apache to Nginx, upping the ram, and switching caching plugins. WordPress is a beast and hard to optimize. That‚Äôs not even the kicker as to why I switched away.</p>
<h4 id="a-call-from-rackspace8230">A Call From Rackspace‚Ä¶</h4>
<p>About a month ago, I realized my blog was down. I figured that it might have been that I was featured somewhere else which was crashing it (again I was rolling my eyes at WordPress). But then, I got a call and email from a <em>very</em> helpful Rackspace employee. The email went like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Despite the very best efforts of or our Engineering and Datacenter Operations Teams, unfortunately the host machine that your cloud server ‚ÄòWebsites‚Äô resides on was not able to be recovered. At this point, we are looking at complete data loss.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and‚Ä¶ Rackspace, in this poorly phrased email, was basically like. ‚ÄúWell, sucks to be you, hope you had a backup!‚Äù. Well, I admit this is partially my fault for not having a backup as I am a bit of a n00b when it comes to server admin, but I had been hosting for years on (don‚Äôt judge me) GoDaddy before that and a couple years on Rackspace. I had no idea that hosting companies didn‚Äôt have backups of their own. It would seem that this might be crucial to their business.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I lost everything including a jewelry site that I ran (not many sales), an iPhone leaderboard site (not very popular), 2 of my buddies WordPress blogs, and my current WordPress blog.</p>
<h4 id="jekyll-to-the-rescue">Jekyll To The Rescue</h4>
<p>I was pretty angry at Rackspace and myself for never making a backup, but then it hit me that <em>most</em> of my posts had been converted to Jekyll and were backed up in a github repository. I was able to restore my blog within a few minutes (now hosted on GitHub) and recover the WordPress posts from the <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/brandontreb">Feedburner cache</a> of my site.</p>
<p>As for my buddies‚Äô sites‚Ä¶ I feel for them <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h4 id="new-list-of-why-jekyll-is-awesome">New List Of Why Jekyll Is Awesome</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Automatically backed up</strong> ‚Äì This is huge. If not for switching to Jekyll at one point, I would have lost <strong>years</strong> worth of content. If you have every tried to back up WordPress, it‚Äôs a huge frackin pain since the database dump usually gets HUGE.</li>
<li><strong>Free To Host</strong> ‚Äì I‚Äôm not sure why I was so stubborn about doing my own hosting. I am now hosting on <a href="https://github.com/brandontreb/brandontreb.github.com">GitHub</a> and it couldn‚Äôt be more stable and fast.</li>
<li><strong>Mobile Blogging</strong> ‚Äì This was my largest gripe about Jekyll. I was jealous that I couldn‚Äôt blog from my iPhone like WordPress users. Well, I have found a pretty decent solution (tutorial to follow), which involves a combo of Prompt, Screen, and Vim.</li>
<li><strong>Content Oriented</strong> ‚Äì WordPress makes it super easy to dump tons of images into your posts. While blogging with Jekyll (inside of Vim in my case), it‚Äôs a little bit more of a pain to add your own images. That being said you must be choosy forcing you to focus more on the content and less on using visual crutches.</li>
<li><strong>Blog Anywhere</strong> ‚Äì This was another limitation I was placing on Jekyll in my last post. However, I just wasn‚Äôt using Jekyll to its full potential. I was building my site locally and rsyncing it up to my server. This process was a little tedious and discouraged me from writing many new posts. Now, hosting with github, posting is as simple as a quick push to the repo.</li>
<li><strong>Ninja Fast</strong> ‚Äì This one should be obvious.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<p>I am quite happy blogging with Jekyll. As far as I‚Äôm concerned there is no reason to ever host my own blog again (as long as Github doesn‚Äôt ditch pages üòâ ). Also, if you currently have stuff on Rackspace, <strong>go make a backup now</strong> (or ditch them altogether). Thanks for reading and <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/brandontreb">look out</a> for my next post about mobile blogging with Jekyll.</p>
<p>Happy Blogging!</p>

  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p>As you may have noticed, my blog has a new (much cleaner) theme. For 2012, my blogging goals are to focus much more on content rather than flashy visuals.</p>
<p>I have also minimized my set up to save blogging costs (I now blog for FREE) and to simplify things greatly. Here is my new setup:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> as my ‚Äúblog engine‚Äù</li>
<li><a href="http://www.wptux.com/206/wp-typo">The WPTypo WordPress Theme</a> I ported this to Jekyll</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/brandontreb/brandontreb.github.com">GitHub</a> for hosting (it‚Äôs free).</li>
<li>Vim ‚Äì I‚Äôm using this as my ‚Äúblog editor‚Äù. There are some incredible plugins that I am using to help facilitate blogging using Jekyll (post on how I do this to follow)</li>
</ul>
<p>That‚Äôs about it. I am now free from server costs and my blog is <strong>always</strong> backed up and easily accessible.</p>
<p>2011 has been a very successful year in terms of blogging for me. In addition to writing here and on <a href="http://icodeblog.com">iCodeBlog</a>, I have recently started blogging for Mobile Tuts + on the <a href="http://envato.com">Envato Network</a>. You can check out my 7 part game series on creating a caterpillar game using Cocos2D <a href="http://mobile.tutsplus.com/series/build-a-caterpillar-game-with-cocos2d/">here</a>.</p>
<p>I can‚Äôt wait to start posting some great content in this new year. Given my new setup, I literally have to adhere to the title of this post as blogging in VIM doesn‚Äôt really lend itself to visuals ;).</p>
<p>Happy New Year and Happy Hacking in 2012!</p>

  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>With all of the buzz around the <a href="http://tether.com">iTether</a> App, I figured I‚Äôd offer a more permanent solution since Apple will surely yank this soon</p>
<p>Last year, a developer published his code for an http <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOCKS">SOCKS</a> proxy called iProxy. This will give your iPhone the ability to create a SOCKS server in which your laptop can connect to via the Bonjur protocol.</p>
<p>Once connect, all of your computer‚Äôs http traffic will be routed through the server on your iPhone essentially giving you <strong>free tethering</strong>. Since this isn‚Äôt using the iPhone‚Äôs built-in tethering method, I‚Äôd assume At&amp;t could not detect it*. After looking at the code, it becomes pretty obvious how the SOCKS proxy works and makes me kick myself that I didn‚Äôt write it (or find this code sooner).</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/tcurdt/iProxy/wiki/Configuring-iProxy">setup</a> is a little complex, but you only need to do it once. I would love to hear in the comments if any of you has had some experience with this. I will also share my own as soon as I can get it installed later today.</p>
<p>Download the project over at <a href="https://github.com/tcurdt/iProxy">github</a>.</p>
<p>Happy Coding!</p>

	<h2><a href="https://brandontreb.github.io/2011/11/16/voices-that-matter-conference-highlights/">Voices That Matter Conference: Highlights</a></h2>
  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p>This past weekend, I attended the voices that matter conference as a sponsor for a new product my team is working called <a href="http://maasive.co">MaaSive</a>. We had an absolute blast at the conference and I learned quite a bit from all of the speakers.</p>
<p>Here were a few of my favorite parts:</p>
<h4 id="keynote-by-graeme-devine">Keynote by Graeme Devine</h4>
<p>For those of you who don‚Äôt know Graeme is a legend in the game development industry. He was responsible for titles such as Quake 3, 7th guest, and Halo Wars. His presentation entitled ‚ÄúSocial Gaming is Dead‚Äù was spot on. In it Graeme talked about how game developers have become less focused on the quality of games and more focused on ‚Äúhow do I make a profit?‚Äù. A statement that has stuck out to me is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúBe generous with fun. We are mean with it!‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically, we are charging our users for fun or making them do real work (see Farmville) in order to obtain it. His message was ‚Äústop it, make something fun, and dont‚Äôt focus on profit‚Äù. Otherwise you are <strong>doomed</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/zaphodgjd">Follow Graeme on Twitter</a></p>
<h4 id="moving-to-3d-by-mike-daily">Moving To 3D by Mike Daily</h4>
<p>Mike is a good friend of mine and I look forward to hanging out with him at the conference each year. His talk was all about showing the developers how easy it actually is to create a 3D game without the use of a game engine. Mike‚Äôs demo (show below) was an absolutely incredible space shooter where you used the gyroscope to maneuver around.</p>
<p>Mike will be posting a series on <a href="http://www.71squared.com/">his blog</a> in the near future about how to make his game using GLKit in the near future.</p>
<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/31690099">VTM Game Prototype</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/michaeldaley">Michael Daley</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/mikedaley">Follow Mike on Twitter</a></p>
<h4 id="storyboarding-by-erica-sadun">Storyboarding by Erica Sadun</h4>
<p>Erica is an OG (original gangster) when it comes to iOS development. She has been in the space since way before the first SDK was published (in fact she had a jailbroken dev book almost ready to go). Her current book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/iPhone-Developers-Cookbook-Building-Applications/dp/0321659570">The iPhone Developer‚Äôs Cookbook</a> is a beast containing almost 900 pages!!!</p>
<p>Her talk showed how easy it is to use storyboarding and just how powerful the technique can be.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/ericasadun">Follow Erica on Twitter</a></p>
<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<p>It should be obvious from this post, that the VTM conference was incredible to say the least. If you didn‚Äôt attend, I strongly urge you to check out their next one. Hopefully you will get to blog about <em>my</em> talk at it (assuming I get my crap together).</p>
<p>Happy Coding!</p>

	<h2><a href="https://brandontreb.github.io/2011/11/14/wordpress-to-jekyll-and-back-again/">WordPress To Jekyll And Back Again</a></h2>
  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p>Earlier this year, I jumped ship on WordPress and moved to Jekyll after reading <a href="http://vitobotta.com/how-to-migrate-from-wordpress-to-jekyll/">this post</a> on Hacker News. I wanted to be 1337! I wanted to ditch the whale that was WordPress.</p>
<p>Well, it was quite a run, but in the end I decided to revert back to WordPress. Although Jekyll is <strong>much faster</strong> than WordPress, here were my issues:</p>
<h4 id="build-times">Build Times</h4>
<p>As my post count grew, so did the time to compile my jekyll site. Jekyll is a static site builder, so naturally it has to rebuild your site any time anything changes. With my blog containing hundreds of posts, my site build times started getting into minutes. I simply don‚Äôt want to wait forever to publish a post.</p>
<p>Since it took <strong>so long</strong> to build my site, it discouraged me from posting. I would only write posts on my specified <a href="http://idevblogaday.com">#iDevBlogADay</a> days, rather than just posting quick info posts.</p>
<h4 id="too-many-dependancies">Too Many Dependancies</h4>
<p>Jekyll is a beast to install, especially if you want to support some of the fancier plugins like syntax highlighting. This limited my blogging to only <em>my</em> machines. I couldn‚Äôt blog from anywhere anymore. I could have installed Jekyll on my server, but that just seems like a hassle, also see my first point about build times.</p>
<h4 id="no-mobile-app">No Mobile App</h4>
<p>I like to blog on the go, and with Jekyll I just couldn‚Äôt find an elegant solution to blog from my iPhone or iPad. I found myself trying to come up with hackish solutions and write custom scripps, but in the end it just wasn‚Äôt worth it.</p>
<h4 id="i-can-now-use-markdown-with-wordpress">I can now use Markdown with WordPress</h4>
<p>I fell in love with Jekyll because I could write in markdown. With <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/markdown-on-save-improved/">this plugin</a>, I can now do just that with WordPress. It stores the Markdown in a separate meta field and generates the post_content html upon publishing the post. So, I‚Äôm not married to the plugin in case I decide to ditch it.</p>
<p>I have also hid the disgusting ‚ÄúVisual Editor‚Äù that WordPress is unfortunate enough to ship with. This makes my writing experience much more pleasant.</p>
<h4 id="the-future">The Future</h4>
<p>While Jekyll was a fun experiment, I think I will stick with WordPress for now.</p>

  </header>

<p>Earlier this year, I launched an application called <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/smart-lockscreen-creator/id419890996?mt=8">Smart Lockscreen Creator</a>. It was a pretty simple app that allowed you to add dynamic data (such as weather) to your wallpaper and save it back out to your camera roll. The idea is to improve the functionality of the user‚Äôs lockscreen. It did very well on launch (and even made it to #1 in the Israel App Store). At the peak, I was selling about 600 copies per day.</p>
<p>Well, the honeymoon period is over and sales have slowed down <strong>quite a bit</strong>, however they have completely stabilized around what I‚Äôm calling the ‚Äúcruising speed‚Äù. So, what‚Äôs my speed? On an average day, I will sell between 10-15 copies of the application per day. This is with no additional marketing, I‚Äôm not on any top 500 pages, and honestly I haven‚Äôt done much to the application at all. The app even has ~2 star rating. Not because it sucks, but because people don‚Äôt read the description and assume it will constantly update their lockscreen.</p>
<p>I have asked a few developers and this seems to be a fairly common cruising speed. So, now I‚Äôm asking you.</p>
<p><strong>What‚Äôs YOUR cruising speed?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do you think updating the application will affect this speed?</strong></p>
<p><strong>What dictates the speed?</strong></p>
<p>I‚Äôd love to hear your responses in the comments.</p>
