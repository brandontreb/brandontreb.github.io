  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p>A while back, I wrote a post called ”<a href="http://brandontreb.com/money-you-might-be-missing-out-on-linkshare-api-integration/">Money You Might Be Missing Out On</a>” where I discussed the <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=U3Wt3JDOKpI&amp;offerid=7097.10000073&amp;subid=0&amp;type=4">Linkshare</a> API. Well, I took it upon myself to create a simple tool that I have been using in my blog posts to quickly generate affiliate iTunes links for iPhone apps. Here is a screenshot of the app.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ol>
<li>Sign up for <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=U3Wt3JDOKpI&amp;offerid=7097.10000073&amp;subid=0&amp;type=4">LinkShare</a> (if you haven’t already done so)</li>
<li>Go to <a href="http://brandontreb.com/apps/linkshare/">http://brandontreb.com/apps/linkshare/</a></li>
<li>Enter your <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=U3Wt3JDOKpI&amp;offerid=7097.10000073&amp;subid=0&amp;type=4">LinkShare</a> Token. You get this in the Web Services section if the <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=U3Wt3JDOKpI&amp;offerid=7097.10000073&amp;subid=0&amp;type=4">LinkShare</a> site when you sign up.</li>
<li>Select a merchant. By default, I have already populated it with Apple iTunes. Linkshare supports thousands of affiliate programs, so you can click other if you are using it for something else besides the app store.</li>
<li>Enter the App Store URL of the application that you wish to get an affiliate link for. (ex <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hundred-pushups/id301174591?mt=8">http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hundred-pushups/id301174591?mt=8</a>)</li>
<li>Click submit</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, it will interface with the LinkShare API and produce an affiliate link for your account.</p>

  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p>Ok, so maybe this is stupid, reposting your own content in multiple areas. As far as SEO goes, it may not be the best idea. However, I really love Tumblr and I really love WordPress. I can’t seem to part with either yet I don’t quite have the time for both.</p>
<p>I put out a quick tweet earlier today (and this is why I flippin love Twitter), asking if anyone knew of a good way to connect WordPress to Twitter. Here are the popular options.</p>
<ol>
<li>Use Tumblr’s feed importer (suggested by <a href="http://twitter.com/abrahamvegh">@abrahamvegh</a>). This option requires you to enter your blog’s RSS feed. Tumblr then scans your RSS feed every so often and pulls the new posts. I didn’t care too much for this approach because it’s not instantaneous. I added my feed and it told me that it would refresh in about an hour. After an hour it still didn’t pull my WordPress posts and had a status of queued.<br>
<a href="http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Screen-shot-2010-09-16-at-10.20.58-PM.png"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></li>
<li><a href="http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Screen-shot-2010-09-16-at-10.20.58-PM.png"></a> There are quite a few Tumblr WordPress plugins out there. I have tried a few and have seen no success. Until one of my twitter followers (**<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/TheSilber">@TheSilber</a>) **suggested that I use <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/tumblrize/">tumblrize</a>. Tumblrize is a great plugin that worked perfectly right out of the box. It was easy to set up and boasts quite a few options.”Tumblrize posts to Tumblr whenever you hit the “publish” button. It uses Tumblr’s simple API to keep posts in sync; when you edit your WordPress post, it updates your Tumblr post.”<br>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
</ol>
<p>I would highly recommend option 2 if you are planning on syncing your WordPress blog with your Tumblr.</p>
<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/tumblrize/">Download Tumblr.ize Here</a></p>
<p>Would love to hear about some other interesting solutions. Feel free to post them in the comments.</p>

	<p>I really enjoyed this article on traits of developers.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.turnleafdesign.com/6-traits-of-successful-developers">http://www.turnleafdesign.com/6-traits-of-successful-developers</a></p>
<p>In my experience, developers tend to become arrogant and totally ignore #1 (see Windows Devs). I feel that this is the most important trait of all.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“For a developer to be successful over any period of time a continued commitment to learning is absolutely vital. The field is too large, too quickly changing, and too in depth for any developer to ever “know it all.” Luckily there are a lot of resources a developer can use to learn; books, co-workers, classes, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->blogs<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, among many others.”</p>

	<h2><a href="https://brandontreb.github.io/2010/09/01/technology-fitness/">Technology &#43; Fitness = &lt;3 :: 3 Apps That Will Keep Even The Laziest Geek In Shape</a></h2>
  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p>If you are reading this post you are most likely a geek. It’s true, otherwise if you were a reader of my blog and not a geek, you would be very confused ;).</p>
<p>Well, being a fellow geek, I am prone to the same sort of problems as you when it comes to fitness. As geeks we sit in our chairs and more often than not end up looking like this. (sad face)</p>
<p><a href="http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/computer-nerd-+-Limpet-21.jpeg"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>Ok ok, that photo is a little cliché, but you get my point. This prolonged sitting along with a lazy (Mountain Dew + Cheetos ) diet leads to this stereotypic geek look.</p>
<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>
<p>Dun duh dun duh (those were trumpet sounds in case you didn’t know). Well, we all love technology (duh), so why not combine it with some basic fitness and fight the stereotype. With sweet gadgets (like the iPhone :)), we now have some incredible tools that almost make a game out of exercise.</p>
<p>Here are 3 iPhone apps that I use on a daily basis to keep me in peak, geek, 1337 shape.</p>
<h3 id="1-100-pushups">#1 100 Pushups</h3>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I stumbled upon this gem of an app when I started seeing my buddy <a href="http://twitter.com/oodelali">@oodelali</a> ‘s Twitter feed displaying the following.</p>
<p><a href="http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2010-08-31-at-11.00.48-AM.png"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>160 Pushups! Gangster right? Intrigued, I asked him about the app. After a brief synopsis, I was sold. Here is the rundown of this app (per its app store description).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If you’re serious about increasing your strength, follow this six week training program and you’ll soon be on your way to completing 100 consecutive push ups!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically, this app utilizes interval training where you exercise <strong>3 times per week</strong> for about 10 minutes. After 6 weeks of this, the app claims you will be able to do <strong>100 consecutive pushups</strong>! Here is a screenshot so you can see what I’m talking about.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So far, I’m on week 4 and am doing a total of 94 pushups (not consecutive yet).</p>
<p>**Don’t have an iPhone (sad face), you can still benefit from this app by using their web interface at **<a href="http://hundredpushups.com/"><strong>http://hundredpushups.com/</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The developer of this app has a whole suit of these including <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=U3Wt3JDOKpI&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=146261.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=3909&amp;RD_PARM1=http%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Ftwo-hundred-situps%2Fid302001331%3Fmt%3D8%2526mt%3D8%2526buylink%3Dyes">200 Sit-ups</a>, <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=U3Wt3JDOKpI&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=146261.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=3909&amp;RD_PARM1=http%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Ftwo-hundred-squats%2Fid314081637%3Fmt%3D8%2526mt%3D8%2526buylink%3Dyes">200 Squats</a>, and <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=U3Wt3JDOKpI&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=146261.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=3909&amp;RD_PARM1=http%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Ftwenty-chinups%2Fid306789203%3Fmt%3D8%2526mt%3D8%2526buylink%3Dyes">Twenty Chin Ups</a>.</p>
<h3 id="2-run-keeper-pro">#2 Run Keeper Pro</h3>
<p><a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=U3Wt3JDOKpI&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=146261.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=3909&amp;RD_PARM1=http%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Frunkeeper-pro%2Fid300235330%3Fmt%3D8%2526mt%3D8%2526buylink%3Dyes"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>Run Keeper Pro is a stellar app that has both paid and free versions. It uses the GPS to map our your run and gives you feedback on elevation, pace, distance, and location. I use this app every single day when I go for runs.</p>
<p>One killer feature of this app is its ability to sync with the web at <a href="http://runkeeper.com/">RunKeeper.com</a>. Here you are able to track more statistics about your runs, create paths, and get more social.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The interface is both beautiful and intuitive. (Aesthetics are super important to me. You could have the most functional app in the world and I won’t use it if it looks like feces).</p>
<p>When I first started running, I could barely make it to the end of my street, and with this app, I am now running over 10 miles per week!</p>
<h3 id="3-ifitness">#3 iFitness</h3>
<p><a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=U3Wt3JDOKpI&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=146261.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=3909&amp;RD_PARM1=http%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fifitness%2Fid290451423%3Fmt%3D8%2526mt%3D8%2526buylink%3Dyes"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>So, this app is for the geek that might actually go to they gym (you mean like…leave…the house). Or if you are really a hobbit, have a home gym. iFiness allows you to track all aspects of a workout. It will track what exercises you do, on what day, with how many reps for how long.</p>
<p><a href="http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/iPhone-Screenshot-1.jpeg"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>With these killer features, it’s easy to create a fully customized workout and track it the way you want.</p>
<p>“But Brandon, I have never been to the gym and don’t know how to use the weights/machines because I’m level 75 in WOW.” Well, iFitiness has got you covered! For every workout they have in the system, they provide full graphics or videos on how to perform each one. So if you are unsure about how to do anything, just take a quick peak at your phone, jump on the machine, get jacked, and the ladies (or dudes if you are a lady reading this) will be flocking from all over.</p>
<p>Another great feature of this app is that it has built in workout plans to suite your lifestyle. So weather or not you want to build muscle or you just want to lose that gut you have been working on, they have a plan for you. Whoa, I am starting to sound like a <a href="http://www.beachbody.com/product/fitness_programs/best_sellers/p90x.do?tnt=P90X_SHAKE_B1&amp;code=P90XDOTCOM">P90X</a> commercial, time to pump the breaks.</p>
<h2 id="take-away">Take Away</h2>
<p>To wrap up, I feel that staying healthy and fit is very important. You have to make it a part of your lifestyle and these few tools are a great way to get a jump on it. Feel free to post comments, questions, or grammar corrections (expected bc we are all the grammar police) in the comments.</p>

  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p>If you have a WordPress blog and an iPhone/iPad, then you most likely have the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wordpress/id335703880?mt=8">WordPress for iOS</a> app. If you don’t, you <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wordpress/id335703880?mt=8">should</a>.</p>
<p>Over the past couple of days, I have been receiving the following error when trying to add my blog to the iPhone app.</p>
<p><a href="http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/photo.png"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>After scouring the internet, I found that this could be the result of a few issues.</p>
<ul>
<li>Special characters in a post body that are not supported by NSXMLParser</li>
<li>Special characters in a comment</li>
<li>Invalid post or comment RSS</li>
<li>An error in a theme/plugin file</li>
</ul>
<p>For me, this turned out to be an issue with the comments RSS feed. I loaded it up in the browser and long behold, even the browser threw an error. But what could be causing this? Turns out, I had left a space in a plugin that I created. This caused a space to be output at the beginning of the comments XML, causing it to error. Notice the space between ?&gt; and &lt;?php below. (Face Palm)</p>
<p><a href="http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Screen-shot-2010-08-30-at-10.05.22-AM.png"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>After removing the space from this plugin, I loaded up WordPress for iPhone and it added my blog without a problem.</p>
<p>So, the take away from this is <strong>don’t output spaces when you create a plugin.</strong></p>
<p>I hope this post has proven useful for you, I can’t imagine that I’m the only person with this issue 😉</p>

	<h2><a href="https://brandontreb.github.io/2010/08/27/feedburner-anywhere-plugin-updated/">Feedburner Anywhere Plugin Updated</a></h2>
  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p>I have updated my WordPress plugin Feedburner Anywhere. In case you are unfamiliar with it, it’s a plugin that allows you to output your Feedburner subscriber count anywhere on your blog.</p>
<p>**The Problem: **Since Google took over Feedburner, I feel that it has been quite unreliable. A few times a week, Feedburner would return 0 for your subscriber count. This was an issue with the plugin. If the return value was 0 when the plugin pulled and cached the feedburner data, you would look like you had no subscribers.</p>
<p><strong>The Fix:</strong> I am now caching the values returned from Feedburner. If for any reason Feedburner returns a 0 subscriber count, the last known value (greater than 0) is used instead.</p>

<p>If you have any other suggestions for the plugin, please let me know.</p>

<ul>
<li>Improved posture – sitting on the ball forces you to sit up straight of you won’t be very comfortable</li>
<li>Constant movement – Sitting for long periods of time can be bad for you, even when you exercise. Check out this <a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/14/phys-ed-the-men-who-stare-at-screens/">recent study</a> that was discussed on the New York Times. When you use an exercise ball for a chair, you are constantly repositioning yourself and are combatting this issue.</li>
<li>Getting Jacked! – having a ball for a chair has encouraged me to exercise during my down time. Code is compiling…bang out some crunches. I will now do ~ 300 crunches per day while waiting for various tasks to complete.</li>
<li>They are cheap – Most exercise balls range from $15-$25. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FH2W4A?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=codnerandnon-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000FH2W4A">Check out Amazon for some deals</a>. I recently purchased one at Target on sale for $9.</li>
<li>It’s fun – Need a break? Just bounce a bit on the ball 😉</li>
</ul>
<p>While I’m not saying to completely replace your office chair with an exercise ball (you will end up switching back an fourth a bit), it is a great way to stay in shape and enforce good posture while at work.</p>
