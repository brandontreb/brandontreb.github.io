<p>What is really concerning is the fact they they don’t mention anything related to how they are achieving iOS notifications. Pebble has been very upfront in stating that they are planning on leveraging <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ifttt.com<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to deliver complex notifications such as Twitter and Facebook.

	<h2><a href="https://brandontreb.github.io/2012/05/01/why-you-should-check-out-unity/">Why you Should Check Out Unity</a></h2>
  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p>A while back, my buddy <a href="http://twitter.com/seantron">seantron</a> showed me some of his 3D games he’d been working on <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hamsteria!/id470730689?mt=8">including this one</a>. My initial reaction was “how the heck did he get the chopps to do that?”. While, Sean is an incredible developer with a ton of creativity, doing things like loading models, texture mapping, or even basic 3D projects are flippin hard.</p>
<p>A while back I <a href="http://brandontreb.com/ludum-dare-competition-week-2-update/">tried my hand at 3D</a> and made sort of a <em>basic</em> Minecraft style game from scratch using OpenGL ES. Let me tell you, it was brutal (and I have been coding for almost 10 years). This project took me a week or so to ramp up, get basic cubes and textures going and a simple first person view.</p>
<h4 id="enter-unity">Enter Unity</h4>
<p>Sean had mentioned to me that he used this 3D engine called Unity to create his games. While I had tried XNA, I had never heard of Unity and figured it was similar (basically a framework with some convenience methods for loading models, mapping, etc…). Boy was I wrong…</p>
<p>Unity 3D is more than just an engine. It is an application that allows even the most novice of developers to create beautiful, rich, 3D games. I’m serious. Check out this demo below of an app I made in unity in about 3 hours using <a href="http://active.tutsplus.com/tutorials/unity/getting-started-with-unity/">this tutorial</a>. The crazy part is, I wrote <em>almost</em> no code. Much of the interactions and game were developed using drag and drop and <strong>free</strong> assets.</p>
<p><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1574088/unity/tuts-plus/TutsPlus.html">Link to my awesome game</a></p>
<h4 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h4>
<p>I was very reluctant to learn Unity at first as the interface appears to be a bit daunting. However, once you check out a few tutorials, it becomes second nature. Here are a few places to get started:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMWhtKjUr10">InfinitAmmo’s Unity 3D tutorial series</a> – This was where I first began. He does a great job at going over the basics of Unity while keeping things interesting.</p>
<p><a href="http://active.tutsplus.com/tutorials/unity/getting-started-with-unity/">Getting Started With Unity on Active Tuts+</a> – This is where I made the game you checked out above. Take an hour and do the first in the series, you will be very surprised with the outcome.</p>
<p><a href="http://unity3d.com/support/resources/tutorials/">Unity 3D tutorials</a> – Unity has a wealth of information and demo projects on their website. They come with the source and comprehensive PDFs detailing various aspects of each of their demo games.</p>
<p>After completing at least the top two series’, you <em>should</em> have enough knowledge to begin hacking on a game of your own. I know that I do <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<p>I hope this has been enlightening and I really urge you to check out Unity.</p>

	<h2><a href="https://brandontreb.github.io/2012/04/27/i-suck-at-blogging-lately/">I Suck At Blogging (Lately)</a></h2>
  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p>OK, so the title isn’t entirely true (I have maintained quite a few blogs in my day). But, one thing is for sure, I have sucked at blogging <strong>lately</strong>. So much so, I just had to think hard about having to bold lately using markdown in the previous sentence <em>#meta</em>.</p>
<h4 id="burnout">Burnout</h4>
<p>I was blogging very consistently for the <a href="http://envato.com">Envato Network</a> on their <a href="http://mobile.tutsplus.com">Mobile Tuts Plus</a> as well as on <a href="http://icodeblog.com">iCodeBlog</a> and here. Eventually, I got burnt out and gave up blogging on every blog (for the month).</p>
<p>What happened was, I was blogging to make money (Envato pays $250/post!) and no longer for fun. This sucks and I was missing deadlines and writing crappy content which needed much revision.</p>
<h4 id="new-plan">New Plan</h4>
<p>Write here only (for fun!) and infrequently on icode if time permits as I can do that during work time 😉 That being said, expect to see more content here for better or worse. Once a week is the new goal.</p>
<h4 id="shutup">Shutup</h4>
<p>That’s what you are saying to me. I hate these “Sorry I haven’t been around in a while. I promise to post more” posts that are usually the last posts on a blog for like 5 years just as much as you do. Let’s hope that’s not the case here. You will just have to trust me and <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/brandontreb">subscribe</a>.</p>
<p>Also, I have a sweet new theme from <a href="http://jekyllbootstrap.com/">Jekyll Bootstrap</a>.</p>

  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p>I used to be an Emacs guy and would battle to the death on the war between Vim and Emacs. It wasn’t until a coworker of mine sat down and really showed me just how cool/simple/powerful Vim can be. Just using Vim is a new adventure every day and has really improved my productivity. I now use it to code, blog, and even jot down quick notes.</p>
<p>Last week, I saw on Hacker News a link announcing <a href="http://applidium.com/en/applications/vim/">Vim has been ported to iOS</a>. I have spent a week or so with it and can honestly say the port is almost perfect!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It has <em>most</em> of the major Vim features and commands including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatic indentation</li>
<li>Visual mode (block operations)</li>
<li>Language-aware syntax highlighting</li>
<li>Integrated scripting language that lets you extend functionalities</li>
<li>Macros recording and playback</li>
<li>Markers management (to quickly move around the edited file)</li>
<li>Multiple clipboards</li>
</ul>
<p>You even have access to the config file to remap keys and define your own custom macros.</p>
<p>There are a few features that would make this better on mobile however:</p>
<ol>
<li>Dropbox Support – Currently you must use iTunes to work with Vim documents on mobile. There needs to be an easier way to share these.</li>
<li>Keyboard bar – Since you have to switch modes so frequently and there are some keys you type often ( “:” ), it would be nice to have quick access to these.</li>
<li>Plugin support – This is an Apple limitation <!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
<li>NERDTree – The file browser that’s built in doesn’t work too well.</li>
</ol>
<p>With Vim mobile, you can now look <em>even more</em> nerdy on your iPhone 😉</p>

  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p>As of OSX Lion, I have started to seriously loathe some of the build-it Mac apps (such as Mail, and iCal). While I previously had no issues with them, they now seem to be very clunky and crash quite often. Being a developer, I thought “why don’t I write an app that wraps web apps for you so you basically get “native web apps” that have icons and are launchable?”.</p>
<p>After a quick Google search, I realized <strong><a href="http://fluidapp.com/">this already exists!</a></strong>. The app is called Fluid and it does an incredible job of what I described above and more.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here are the feature highlights.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a “native” Mac app for any web app</li>
<li>Custom icon for each “native” app you create</li>
<li>Full screen mode</li>
<li>User scripps. These are my favorite. They allow you to update the badge count based on information in the browser. See below for a sample user script.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sample User Script For Twitter</strong></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/review/88425">Source</a></p>
<p>Fluid is free with some minimal features, but I urge you to drop the $4.99 to gain full screen mode and user scripts. It’s well worth it. I am not affiliated with them in any way, just a happy customer.</p>

  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p>tl;dr; Don’t buy a Kindle Fire for your kid until they resolve the parental control issues. Wifi password protection is their current solution, and it sucks.</p>
<p>Like many parents, I thought it would be a good idea to get a tablet device for my son so that he could play some <em>educational</em> games and watch some Netflix (in moderation of course). After doing quite a bit of research, I settled on the Kindle Fire. Before the Apple fanboys give me crap, know that I am one, I have an iPad, it’s too expensive for my son.</p>
<p>Honestly, I really love the fire. I think it has the <em>least terrible</em> Android interface of any of the devices. It’s intuitive and my 3 year old was able to grasp navigation right away. In addition to navigation, he quickly figured out how to acquire new content (apps, video, children’s books) thanks to Amazon’s “One-Click Ordering”. Obviously, Amazon thought the process they use on the web transfered well to a tablet device and was not willing to compromise on that. That’s neither here nor there. You can find plenty of posts about user’s complaining about the <strong>initial</strong> lack of parental controls.</p>
<h4 id="the-update">The Update</h4>
<p>Shortly after receiving some pretty rough reviews for their interface, Amazon rolled out their first update which brought us to 6.2.1. In addition to fixing some of there terribly choppy UI, they rolled out their “fix” for the lack of parental controls.</p>
<p>I noticed a new security setting that I had hoped would allow the device to require a password for content purchase, but it turns out the setting is to password protect enabling wifi.</p>
<p><strong>Password protect enabling wifi? Really?</strong></p>
<p>This is laughable at best. What a worthless feature. I could not figure out why anyone would ever want that. And then I had a conversation with “tech support”.</p>
<h4 id="their-8220solution8221-confirmed">Their “Solution” Confirmed</h4>
<p>After seeing an email from Amazon the other day showing my purchase for $17.99 for Team Umizoomi Season 1 (whatever the crap that is), which obviously my son purchased, I set out to chat with customer support. The conversation went something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> Refund!? No parental controls!</p>
<p><strong>Outsourced Guy:</strong> Enable Wifi Password = protection!</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> No, watch Netflix! Browse Web! Stupid Solution</p>
<p><strong>Outsourced Guy:</strong> Yes Netflix Need Wifi. Did I solve your problem?</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> ?</p>
<p><strong>Outsourced Guy:</strong> Phone Number. Call Video Support</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So there you have it. Amazon actually pushes this as their solution to the lack of parental controls. My suspicions were confirmed by Outsourced Guy.</p>
<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<p>It’s sad that a huge company such as Amazon feels that <em>their process</em> is more important than listening to their customers. Although their devices have been selling like <em>fire</em> (badum ch!), they need to address such gaping issues if they are to maintain their edge in the “affordable” tablet space. Especially as the younger generations start embracing the technology.</p>
