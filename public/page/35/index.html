	<h2><a href="https://brandontreb.github.io/2018/11/28/tips-for-starting-your-cs/">Tips For Starting Your CS Career</a></h2>
  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p>My little brother was recently in town for the holidays. He’s about to graduate from college with a CS degree, so naturally we talked about searching for a job.</p>
<p>I figured I would share the advice I gave to him here in hopes that it might help others.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Don’t be discouraged when you get turned down.</strong> Having hired many employees over the years, I have learned that there are <em>so many</em> reasons to not hire a candidate. Much of the time they don’t even have to do with qualifications. In the past, we would just interview with no intention of hiring to test the waters.</li>
<li><strong>Work with recruiters</strong> there is little downside in working with recruiters as a job seeker. Give them tight parameters about what you are looking for (position, location, etc&hellip;) and tell them not to bother you unless there is a match. Often, recruiters will have better “ins” with hiring managers, so your resume won’t get filtered as often by some algorithm.</li>
<li><strong>Network</strong> I almost wrote that in all caps. Attend local meetups, take people out to coffee, and get connected in the local tech scene. Don’t give me that “I don’t live close to tech” nonsense . I live in a suburb of ABQ (not a big tech town) and still managed to build a killer network of tech locals.</li>
<li><strong>Always be searching for a job</strong> (especially if you already have one). Part of your job, is to find a job/a better job (or at least leverage to get paid more in your current) (longer post on this later).</li>
<li><strong>Shoot for the stars, but be ok landing on the moon</strong> This is more for new grads. Landing a job will give you that confidence boost you need to begin your life outside college. So, don’t stress about landing the dream job at Google on day one (by all means apply though). Just take a job and then see the previous bullet point.</li>
</ul>
<p>Happy job hunting!</p>

	<h2><a href="https://brandontreb.github.io/2018/11/27/no-one-cares-about-your/">No One Cares About Your Clever Code</a></h2>
  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p>As developers, we spend so much time perfecting our craft. We are always on the hunt for hacks, tips, and tweaks.</p>
<p>We always set out to write the most clever and reusable code possible. This is all great&hellip;until it’s time to ship.</p>
<p>I have seen it time after time. Developers over-optimizing their code, writing protocol after protocol. All the while, they slip further and further behind schedule.</p>
<p>When the client asks the dev about the delay on feature X, the dev proceeds to explain the super cool reusable, component-driven,state managed, highly available, future proof, buzzword, buzzword system they are creating. The client literally doesn’t care about all that. They just wants to see feature X working.</p>
<p>I love clever code as much as the next developer, but sometimes you’ve got to table your inner CS geek and just ship something that works. Then, refactor later.</p>

  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p>In our house, we often joke that “the diet starts Monday”. Usually, this is in response to some conclusion that we are not currently on the healthiest path.</p>
<p>Procrastination is in our DNA. We put everything off until the absolute last minute. For me, it’s usually side projects. Projects that I know will make some revenue to supplement some of my consulting income. It’s my goal to eventually move on from consulting, however that has been on my “resolution list” for years, with little progress.</p>
<p>I’m committed to finishing one such project before the years up. I should get hacking on it&hellip;on Monday.</p>

  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p>It’s often much easier to have a sense of gratitude when things are going well. As humans, we are prone to focusing on the one bad thing that’s going wrong rather than the multitude of good things going right. This traces way back to a time where we needed this sense to stay away from danger.</p>
<p>My father-in-law was just admitted to the hospital with lukeumia. Although this is one of the harder times in our family’s lives, it’s really been a sobering experience giving me a stronger sense of gratitude for my wife and kids.</p>
<p>I appreciate them more now than ever and am grateful for their health and spirit.</p>
<p>I wish you and your family blessings today, and pray that you too can always find gratitude, even in tribulation.</p>
<p>Happy Thanksgiving!</p>

	<h2><a href="https://brandontreb.github.io/2018/11/22/prototypes-usually-end-up-in/">Prototypes Usually End Up In Production</a></h2>
  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p>“Just hack a quick proof of concept, we’ll rebuild it when we get more funding.”  These are some words I often hear from clients who have minimal budgets.</p>
<p>They generally want my team to build something small/quick/cheap to get their concept across in hopes of securing more funds down the road.</p>
<p>What I have learned by saying “yes” to these types of requests in the past is, those quickly hacked prototypes often end up in production.</p>
<p>While this is not necessarily a bad thing, it’s sometimes problematic if we viewed the code as disposable up front. Normally, a client will have you ship a prototype and then will want to quickly iterate. If you are not careful, you will soon accrue technical debt and eventually sour your relationship with the client due to underperforming.</p>
<p>So, if you are ever asked to do a quick prototype, do yourself a favor and treat it as if it will be production-ready from day one. You never know how long you will be supporting it.</p>
