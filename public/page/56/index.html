	<h2 id="this-tutorial-has-moved-i-have-updated-it-to-support-twitter8217s-oauth-you-can-find-the-first-tutorial-in-there-series-by-clicking-the-link-below">This tutorial has moved! I have updated it to support Twitter’s Oauth, you can find the first tutorial in there series by clicking the link below</h2>
<h2 id="creating-a-twitter-client-for-osx--part-11"><a href="http://brandontreb.com/creating-a-twitter-client-for-osx-part-1/">Creating A Twitter Client For OSX – Part 1</a></h2>
<p>This is part 2 in our series about creating a Twitter client in Objective-C. In case you missed it, here is a <a href="http://brandontreb.com/objective-c-programming-tutorial-creating-a-twitter-client-part-1/">link to part 1</a> of this series.</p>
<p>In the last tutorial I showed you how to retrieve data from Twitter and display the XML in the Console. Today, we will be focusing on sending messages to Twitter via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POST_(HTTP)">POST</a>. We will be implementing the code to update our Twitter status. So let’s just dig right in.</p>
<h2 id="1-updating-the-twitterrequest-header-file">1. Updating The TwitterRequest Header File</h2>
<p>Open up TwitterRequest.h and add the following code (Click the image to enlarge)</p>
<p><a href="http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/screenshot_16.png"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>We have added two properties. The first <strong>isPost</strong> will be true when we are calling a method that requires a POST to Twitter. This will be methods such as update_status, follow, etc… Next, the variable <strong>requestBody</strong> will hold the POST arguments that will be sent to Twitter. These will be things such as status text or friend id.</p>
<p>Finally, we will be adding a method called <strong>statuses_update</strong>. The reason I named it this is because that is what the method is called in the <a href="http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Twitter-API-Documentation">Twitter API</a>. Like our <strong>friends_timeline</strong> method, it takes a delegate and selector to call when the request is complete.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> I didn’t highlight this in the screenshot but make sure you change <strong>theRequest</strong> from an <strong>NSURLRequest</strong> to <strong>NSMutableURLRequest</strong>. It will give us some additional methods to set up the POST.</p>
<h2 id="2-updating-the-twitter-request-class">2. Updating The Twitter Request Class</h2>
<p>Open up **TwitterRequest.m **and add the following code (Click the image to enlarge):</p>
<p><a href="http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/screenshot_17.png"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>I’ll start by explaining the <strong>status_update</strong> method. We first set the global <strong>isPost</strong> property to true. This will tell the request method to make a POST. The next 2 lines set the callback stuff as we did before. The only new line here is setting the <strong>requestBody</strong> variable. This is just a string that looks like “status=new twitter status”.</p>
<p>The addition to the **request **method is what will allow us to POST to Twitter. First, we check if the <strong>isPost</strong> property is set. This will be true if <strong>request</strong> is called from our **status_update **method. Next, we call the <strong>setHTTPMethod</strong> of the request to POST. This is pretty obvious.</p>
<p>The following line let’s Twitter know the type of data that we are sending to it. Next, we call <strong>setHTTPBody</strong> to set the body of the request. At some point we will want to URL Encode this string, but that will be for a different tutorial. Just don’t use any special characters such as &amp; and = in your update to Twitter right now. All that is happening on this line is we convert the string to NSData using the **dataUsingEncoding **method of NSString and set it to the HTTPBody.</p>
<p>The last line just sets the Content-Length property to the length of our string. This is needed to correctly do a POST.</p>
<h2 id="3-calling-the-statuses_update-method-to-update-your-twitter-status">3. Calling The statuses_update Method To Update Your Twitter Status</h2>
<p>Open up <strong>ApplicationDelegate.m</strong> and add the following code (click the image to enlarge):</p>
<p><a href="http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/screenshot_03.jpg"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>One thing to notice here is I commented out the line to get the friends timeline. This is because having both requests running at the same time with the same request object could cause conflicts. The best way to approch this to create an entirly new TwitterRequest object. I just wanted to keep it short.</p>
<p>This is pretty straight forward. We call the <strong>statuses_update</strong> method the same way we called the <strong>friends_timeline</strong> method except pass in the update text. The information received back from Twitter will look something like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/screenshot_01.jpg"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>It’s basically all of your personal profile information.</p>
<p>That’s it for today. If you have any comments or questions, feel free to leave them in the comments of this post or <a href="http://twitter.com/brandontreb">write me on Twitter</a>. You can also download the source for this version below.</p>

	<h2><a href="https://brandontreb.github.io/2009/07/23/installing-and-deploying-rails-on-a-red-hat-server-with-passenger/">Installing And Deploying Rails On A Red Hat Server With Passenger</a></h2>
  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p><a href="http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/rails1.png"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a>I have long been a fan of Ruby on Rails and even jumper on board very early on. The one thing that has held me back from using it in the majority of my projects is the fact that it’s such a pain to configure with Apache.</p>
<p>I know what you are saying… Just switch to a more Rails friendly server. I like and know Apache. Not to mention I also host PHP apps.</p>
<p>With the (re)release of tagacloud, I have recently fell in love with ruby on rails again. So, I looked for a better solution for installation (last time I installed it was 3 years ago) and I stumbled upon <a href="http://www.modrails.com/">Passenger</a>.</p>
<p>It was super easy to use and had my running on Rails in no time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Deployment is only a matter of uploading application files. No Ruby (on Rails)-specific server configuration required!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just to give you some background, here are some details about my server.</p>
<p><strong>OS:</strong> Linux</p>
<p><strong>Distribution:</strong> Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 5.3 Hosted At Server Beach</p>
<p><strong>Control Panel:</strong> Plesk 8.6</p>
<p>And here are the steps I took to get Ruby on Rails up and running from scratch</p>
<h2 id="1-install-ruby">1. Install Ruby</h2>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This will do some magic and install Ruby on your system…</p>
<h2 id="2-download-and-install-ruby-gems">2. Download And Install Ruby Gems</h2>
<p>Head on over to <a href="http://rubygems.org/">http://rubygems.org/</a> and download the latest version of Ruby Gems. Here is an example of getting the latest version as of the posting date of this article.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Untar this file…</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Navigate to the extracted directory and run the setup script</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="3-install-rails">3. Install Rails</h2>
<p>This will install rails. If it asks you about dependencies, just type “Y”</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="4-install-the-passenger-gem">4. Install The Passenger Gem</h2>
<p>Now that rails has been installed, we need to install <a href="http://www.modrails.com/">Passenger</a>. The installation process is stupid simple. <a href="http://www.modrails.com/">Passenger</a> can be installed via a Ruby Gem.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Now, it will do some stuff and and you some questions. At some point in the process, it will check to see if you have all of the dependencies. <strong>You most likely will not</strong>. Luckily, the geniuses who created Passenger tell you the commands to install all of the dependencies. So just follow the directions and you should be ok.</p>
<h2 id="5-set-up-passenger-for-apache">5. Set Up Passenger For Apache</h2>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It will ask you more questions and install everything needed to run Passenger. Pay attention to the stuff spit out at the end of the process. You will take this and paste it into your httpd.conf file. For example, here is the what mine spit out:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Your <strong>httpd.conf</strong> file is probably located at /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf</p>
<p>You should now be good to go! Navigate to one of your vhosts folder (ex: tagacloud/httpdocs/) and create (or copy) a rails application.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Then set permissions…</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And then a miracle happens… and viola! You (should) have a fully functional up and running. Navigate to <a href="http://domain.com/someRailsApp/public">http://domain.com/someRailsApp/public</a> to see your app in action.</p>
<p>If you have any comments or questions, feel free to leave them in the comments section of this post.</p>

<h3 id="the-idea">The Idea:</h3>
<p>TagACloud is a very unique idea for a website, thus it will take a little explaining to understand all the facets. To take full advantage of the site, you must be the owner or have control over your own website. The idea is to create a tag that represents your website. A tag is a descriptive phrase or a creative tagline describing your site. Once you have added your tag, it gets added to the Tag Cloud. This is where all the fun begins.</p>
<h3 id="the-goal">The Goal:</h3>
<p>The goal is simple. Become the biggest freakin’ tag on the TagACloud website. The bigger the tag, the more hits it gets. It is that simple.</p>
<h3 id="how-your-tag-gets-bigger">How Your Tag Gets Bigger:</h3>
<p>Your tag gets bigger every time it levels up! And the only way to get your tag to level up is by accumulating points. Points can be acquired in many different ways, but the two primary ways to acquire points are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get Clicked: your tag gets 1 point for every click that your tag receives.</li>
<li>Incoming Hits: your tag gets 2 points for every hit you send to your tag on TagACloud.com. You can get tag specific code via your “Get Tag Code” page.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="how-your-tag-gets-hits">How Your Tag Gets Hits</h3>
<p>We provide visitors several ways to find your tag:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Home Page: The home page features 200 random tags in random order.</li>
<li>Popular Tags: If your tag is one of the 200 most popular today, the last 7 days, last month, or of all time; it will be featured in order of popularity on the applicable page.</li>
<li>Keywords: Keywords are essential for any tag that wants to generate hits. Keywords are like user defined categories. We combine all the tags that share common keywords. For example, google.com, yahoo.com, and vanillasasquatch.com would all share the keyword, SearchEngine. Each tag can have up to 3 keywords associated with it.</li>
<li>The Randomizer: The title says it all. A user can view a random tag’s website, or view a random keyword.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="statistics">Statistics</h3>
<p>There are 3 big addictions on the web. Without sharing the top 2, we will let you know #3, is statistics. People love to view the stats on anything and everything. Here at TagACloud, we will make sure not to disappoint. You will be able to view statistics for every little thing, to ensure that you always know the current state of your tag. You will also find the website itself is littered with stats. Just keep your eyes open.<br>
<a href="../wp-content/uploads/2009/07/tagacloud.jpg"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>As of late 2007, Tagacloud was booming with over <strong>10,000 users</strong>. Then, one day JJ and I decided we would take a weekend and “improve” tagacloud. Now, if any of you are programmers, you know “improving” an app takes much longer than you anticipate.</p>
<p>We set out to do it in a weekend and the ideas started flowing. It was Facebook meets Halo 3 meets Digg meets Hannah Montanna meets Karate Kid 3… And then the weekend ended and Tagacloud would remain a “Coming Soon” page for a year and a half… <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago, JJ and I were sitting around and thought to ourselves “Why did we ever take down the old tagacloud?”. One thing led to another and we decided to completely wipe the database and start tagacloud fresh.</p>
<p>So, go fourth and start <a href="http://tagacloud.com">leveling your tag</a>.</p>

<p>So, I started this site called <a href="http://iphonelb.com">iphonelb.com</a> a few months back and left out a very important feature. The ability to edit your applications!?! What this means is, users have been testing their apps and putting in “test data” and when it comes time for release, the can’t modify it.</p>
<p>Another feature missing, was the ability to clean out all of your test scores.</p>
<p>Well, thanks to about 8 minutes of my time, this has been resolved and the feature has been added. I am really excited about iphonelb and have some big things planned for it in the future. <a href="http://twitter.com/brandontreb">Write me on Twitter</a> or on my blog if you have any feature requests for it.</p>

  <section class="post-body">
	<p><a href="http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/twitter_trends.png"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>Twitter Trends are a very interesting part of Twitter. They are basically the most typed keywords or <a href="http://twitter.pbwiki.com/Hashtags">hashtags</a> on twitter for a given day. Some examples might be <a href="http://twitter.com/timeline/search?q=%23musicmonday&amp;source=sidebar&amp;category=trends">#musicmonday</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/timeline/search?q=MacHeist&amp;source=sidebar&amp;category=trends">macHeist</a>. These are fun and all but how can you use them to get traffic to my website/blog…</p>
<h2 id="find-trends-that-refer-to-articles-people-are-linking-to">Find Trends That Refer To Articles People Are Linking To?</h2>
<p>Well, often times trends refer to words associated with website articles, videos, images, etc… For example, the other day, the word mashable was trending on Twitter. This was because Mashable.com had just put out an <a href="http://mashable.com/2009/04/04/twitter-trends/">article</a> on twitter trends. Since people were talking about and more importantly <strong>linking to</strong> this article, the word mashtable was trending…Naturally, this article got quite a bit of traffic.</p>
<h2 id="post-a-comment-on-the-article">Post a Comment On The Article</h2>
<p>So, I commented on the article leaving a link to my blog. That day, I got ~50 extra uniques to my blog! You can do the same by closely following the trends. Make sure you read the article and are not just spamming the comments section. Many articles use blog systems (such as WordPress) that allow you to link to your website/blog in your commentsl. Post a comment that contributes to the discussion and I guaruntee it will generate more traffic to your website/blog. Again, don’t be a spammer, contribute something to the discussion…</p>
<h2 id="be-prompt-comment-early">Be Prompt (comment early)</h2>
<p>The sooner you comment on the article, the more traffic it will generate to your site. In the above example, I was like the 15th or 16th to commenter. Imagine if I had been the first…</p>
<p>Although this method isn’t perfect, it’s a sure fire way to generate some quick traffic for your blog/website. Do this every day, and you could be huge!</p>
