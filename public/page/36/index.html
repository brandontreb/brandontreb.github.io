	<h2><a href="https://brandontreb.github.io/2018/11/21/cold-emailing-locals/">Cold Emailing Locals</a></h2>
  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p>I always receive cold emails. Some of them are personalized, and some of them are robotic. Sometimes, I’ll ignore and sometimes I’ll respond with something snarky (this is my spiritual gift). I get it. These are just part of the internet.</p>
<p>Whenever I get a cold email from someone local, it’s a different story.  I always feel sorry for them. They have totally missed an opportunity to connect with someone in <em>real life</em> and possibly a sale.</p>
<p>These are the emails in which I’ll generally reply with some practical advice.</p>
<p><strong>If you are desiring to cold email people in your area</strong></p>
<p>Rather than emailing “Dear Brandon, I really think your business could benefit from our website services.”, you should <strong>always</strong> do at least 5 seconds of research.</p>
<p>Start by saying “Brandon, I really loved your post on Staying Fit With 3 Kids, I’d love to buy you coffee and pick your brain”. This shows you are interested and care about them at a human level (which you should anyway) and greatly increases the chances of them buying the services you are selling.</p>
<p>At worst, you will have connected with a likeminded individual who could/would potentially refer others to you in the future. At best, you could get all of the above plus a new customer and friend.</p>
<p>So, the next time you are cold emailing someone who’s within driving distance from you, give this post another read and consider a more personal approach.</p>

	<h2><a href="https://brandontreb.github.io/2018/11/19/blogging-builds-community/">Blogging Builds Community</a></h2>
  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p>It's been around 3 weeks since I started <a href="http://www.brandontreb.com/on-blogging-more-frequently.html">blogging every weekday</a>.  This experience has been nothing short of delightful.</p>
<p>While I have seen many improvements in my communication (written and verbal), I believe the best benefit is around the community.</p>
<p>When I started blogging in 2008, my posts used to have upwards of 100 comments. Granted I was a renegade blogging about iOS in a time of Apple's dreaded NDA. I absolutely <strong>loved</strong> the feedback and the community that was forming around my writing.  I have been blogging on and off since then and have never felt that same spark.</p>
<p>This all changed, when I made a commitment to writing daily short-form blog posts and posting them to <a href="https://micro.blog/brandontreb">micro.blog</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/brandontreb">twitter</a>.  I began to receive comments, and these comments turned into <em>real</em> discussions.</p>
<p>This has been a blast as I'm now able to connect with so many wonderful people in the community.  We are sharing thoughts and ideas and challenging each other’s beliefs on tech, business, etc…</p>
<p>So, I challenge you. If you are on the fence, just stop worrying about the quality/frequency/etc&hellip; of your writing and just write.  And once you have written, share it with others.  I promise you, the community you will build is worth it!</p>

  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p>I was recently listening to <a href="https://overcast.fm/+KebuxnetQ">Episode 344- 10 Strategies To Be Happier Through Gratitude</a> on the Tim Ferris Show. Oddly enough, I much prefer episodes where Tim is absent. I do love him, but sometimes feels he steals the conversation.</p>
<p>Anyway, the episode was hosted by a guy named A.J. Jacobs. Jacobs <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thanks-Thousand-Gratitude-Journey-Books/dp/1501119923">wrote a book on gratitude</a> and is known for traveling the world to thank over 1,000 people involved in his morning coffee (think farmer, roaster, truck driver, etc&hellip;).</p>
<p>While I loved the episode, there was something super interesting that I took from it. Jacobs keeps a notebook where he writes down just <em>one thing</em> that he takes away from every book, podcast, and blog.</p>
<p>I love this idea. Often, I will read something, get super inspired, only to forget about it and never apply it.</p>
<p>I feel that this is a great strategy and think it will make for an interesting post on this blog every so often. Think of it as mini book/podcast/blog reviews that highlight what I found to be important.</p>
<p>So my “one thing” from that episode is to start writing down the “one things” from other pieces of media.</p>

  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p>I had the amazing opportunity today to hit <strong>File -&gt; New Project</strong> today. There are few feelings in the world as great as the optimism that comes from starting a brand new project.</p>
<p>“This one will be different”, I murmur to myself. “I will keep it clean, organized, and free from hacks. “, I cheerfully gloat.</p>
<p>Why is it that it’s so hard to follow through on this philosophy? I said it <a href="http://www.brandontreb.com/client-deliveries-are-hard.html">yesterday</a>, coding is hard. Requirements change, clients change, and most notibly, we change.</p>
<p>“End of the project Brandon” is usually cursing “Beginning of the project Brandon” for using some library, not commenting his code, or lazily failing to follow best practices.</p>
<p>But not this time, oh no. This time WILL BE different&hellip;</p>

	<h2><a href="https://brandontreb.github.io/2018/11/14/client-deliveries-are-hard/">Client Deliveries Are Hard</a></h2>
  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p>I have been building software for clients for over a decade now and have come to one solid conclusion: <strong>deliveries suck</strong>.</p>
<p>Maybe I'm just the worst developer in the world and have worked with the worst teams and have had the worst clients… but I doubt it.</p>
<p>I have delivered early, on time, late, with more functionality, exactly the same, and in some cases less functionality (usually due to lack of funding) and still…rough deliveries.</p>
<p>When I say “rough deliveries”, I usually mean angry clients and stressed out developers.  Maybe not angry like the hulk (though I have seen it), but at the very least, passive aggressive comments,  notes of disappointment, etc…</p>
<p>The reason deliveries are hard is because of a misalignment of expectations.  When a client has an idea in their head of how their product should look/feel/function and it's been burning in their mind forever, us developers are doomed from the get go.  We can never deliver perfectly to match this magic piece of software that only exists in our client's mind.</p>
<p>Also, software is hard. It's especially hard to get exactly right on the very first pass. Software is a living and breathing entity that needs lots of care and feeding. It's very tricky to articulate this to someone who doesn't understand that and is paying you 10's of thousands of dollars to build their dream.</p>
<p>We follow a pretty strict agile process, so the client usually sees their build at every&hellip;single&hellip;stage.  They also have full control to report issues, make changes, etc… during the build cycle. Still, for some reason, they are always dumbfounded when it comes time to ship.</p>
<p>So, if you are building for clients, cut yourself some slack.  Know that deliveries will be tough and most of the time, there is nothing you can do to prevent that.</p>

	<h2><a href="https://brandontreb.github.io/2018/11/13/free-business-idea-rv-storage/">Free Business Idea: RV Storage &amp; Rental</a></h2>
  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p>I was having a conversation with my dad the other day and sharing some of my current business ideas with him.  I also mentioned that I often discuss new product/business ideas in public with other people.</p>
<p>His response was obviously “Why would you just give away your ideas?”.  I then proceeded to give him the &quot;Your Ideas Are Worthless Without Proper Execution” spiel.</p>
<p>So, to put my money where my mouth is, I will be sharing my business ideas here; putting them out there in hopes that either a. I get valuable feedback/encouragement or b. someone else builds it and I get to use it.</p>
<p><strong>Business idea</strong></p>
<p>So many people have RVs that are in use roughly 5% on the year.  The other 95% of the time, they sit in disrepair and usually cost the owner money to store them.</p>
<p>While many sites like <a href="https://rvshare.com/">RVShare</a> exist that allow you to essentially &quot;rent out&quot; your RV, they still pose a huge challenge in that the RV must be physically located on the owner's property.</p>
<p>I propose to build an RV storage facility where owners receive the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Free Storage</li>
<li>Free basic upkeep</li>
<li>Free cleaning</li>
<li>Profit Sharing</li>
<li>Insurance</li>
</ol>
<p>In exchange for this, they allow us to rent their RV out at a price we set.  It would function much like RVShare in that would-be RVers reserve one of the RVs we have in our fleet and come pick it up. The RV would be ready to go with a full tank of water, full propane tanks, and a generator.</p>
<p>Once they return the RV, it gets cleaned and prepped for the next renter. Profits from the rental would be shared with the RV owner.</p>
<p>There you have it. I'd love to <a href="http://twitter.com/brandontreb">hear your thoughts</a> and I hope to be sharing more of these in the future.</p>
