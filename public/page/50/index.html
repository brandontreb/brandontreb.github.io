	<p><a href="https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?ii=606601&amp;c=ib&amp;aff=149540&amp;cl=64302"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a>I seem to change my WordPress theme more often than I change my socks. I just tend to get very bored with my blog aesthetics. Not to mention, I will always find someone out there with a cooler blog theme than mine.</p>
<p>After setting up a blog site for the pastor of my church (<a href="http://brownbishop.com">http://brownbishop.com</a>), I fell in love with the<a href="https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?ii=606601&amp;c=ib&amp;aff=149540&amp;cl=64302"> Standard WordPress Theme</a>. Not only is the theme absolutely beautiful out of the box, it‚Äôs also a theme framework giving you TONS of configuration options including custom layouts, social network integration, and analytics integration. I have seen quite a few amazing blogs built on top of the Standard Theme framework that all look incredible but completely different.</p>
<p>So, I urge you to <a href="https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?ii=606601&amp;c=ib&amp;aff=149540&amp;cl=64302">check it out</a>, It‚Äôs kind of pricey ($50), but well worth worth it in my opinion.</p>

  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p>For this blog post, I decided to take a small break from my <a href="http://brandontreb.com/creating-a-twitter-client-for-osx-%E2%80%93-part-3-publishing-tweets/">Twitter Client for Mac</a> tutorial series and discuss something a little more useful üòâ . I felt that a fitness post would be most appropriate around this time of year as all of our ‚ÄúGeek Guts‚Äù begin expanding.</p>
<h4 id="my-fitness-story">My Fitness Story</h4>
<p><a href="http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/geek-gut.png"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a>It‚Äôs December 23rd and as we gear up for Christmas, we are also compiling our New Year‚Äôs resolutions. And I‚Äôm sure that on most people‚Äôs (especially us computer geeks) lists is something related to weight and a healthy lifestyle. So, I wanted to discuss a little bit about how I made fitness a priority in 2010 and how you can too in 2011.</p>
<p>I began my fitness journey at the beginning of 2010 where I weighed in at 185 lbs and had 19% body fat. Now, I am in not way saying that I was a thick dude. I have been blessed with a stellar metabolism, but I definitely didn‚Äôt look ‚Äúin shape‚Äù. More importantly I didn‚Äôt have a clue about living a healthy life style. Being a geek, I sat for hours at my desk every day, eating quick foods and drinking soda.</p>
<p>One night, I saw a commercial for the fitness program P90X and was actually very intrigued. Don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm not including any affiliate links or things of that sort, so please don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm trying to sell you on something. Needless to say, I went on YouTube to find out just how legit this program was. After some browsing, I was quite impressed and inspired. It seemed that after 3 short months (seriously no time), people had changed their entire life around in terms of health and fitness.</p>
<p>So, I did what any geek would do and took a visit to the <em>Bay</em> and acquired a copy from some <em>Pirates</em>. After checking out the program for a week or so, I was hooked and decided to go legit and purchase a copy. Within 3 months, I began to absolutely LOVE exercising, in fact I became a little addicted to it :/ . I learned how to track what foods I was intaking as well as replaced much of the crappy liquids I was drinking with water.</p>
<p>After completion of the program, I was down to 163lbs with a 12% body fat and have been exercising since. I‚Äôm not posting photos because I feel that would be in bad taste. Check out others on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=p90x&amp;aq=f">YouTube</a>.</p>
<h4 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h4>
<p>Now, this is a really lengthy intro (kind of sounds spammy too, sorry), but the point is, it‚Äôs not hard to get into a healthy routine. I have talked to tons of people about my ‚Äútransformation‚Äù (I hate this term), and almost every person asks me how I got started. Everyone either feels that it‚Äôs too late for them, or they will start ‚Äòtomorrow‚Äô. So, here is a formula for you lazy geeks (I can call you that because that‚Äôs what I was last year :))</p>
<ol>
<li>Grab a copy of P90X. Again, I‚Äôm not a P90X salesmen, Pirate a copy if you have to. Just get one! If you want to buy it, it‚Äôs about the cost of 3 months of the gym, which coincidentally is the length of the program (90 days) $120</li>
<li>Buy a resistance band ‚Äì These are everywhere (target, walmart, big 5, etc‚Ä¶) ‚Äì $20</li>
<li>Buy a pull-up bar ‚Äì $30</li>
<li>Quit stalling ‚Äì Start this Monday and let me know how it goes <!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
</ol>
<p>Now, this is just the beginning. The biggest problem with diets/fitness programs/etc is people don‚Äôt look at them as a lifestyle change, they see them as temporary. People say crap like ‚ÄúI want to be XYZlbs or fit into a size J‚Äù. Don‚Äôt do that! Sure these are nice goals to have, but DONT MAKE THEM THE REASON YOU EXERCISE AND EAT HEALTHY. If you do, you are just setting yourself up to fail. Exercise and don‚Äôt eat crap because you want to be healthy. Do it because you are sick of being tired and lethargic all the time.</p>
<h4 id="i-don8217t-have-time-to-exercise">I don‚Äôt have time to exercise</h4>
<p><a href="http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/dali-clock.jpeg"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a>Of course you would say that‚Ä¶ I did too. That‚Äôs why I love P90X. It‚Äôs only 1 hour a day and within that hour, you are told exactly what to do. I always felt that to exercise, I had to spend hours in the gym, running, lifting, blah blah‚Ä¶ No, one hour a day. I spend that reading Reddit. Get up an hour earlier, go to bed an hour later. Stop eating on your lunch break and exercise then. You can always eat at your desk when you get back.</p>
<h4 id="staying-motivated">Staying Motivated</h4>
<p>So, you have decided that 2011 is going to be your year; you are going to get in shape. Here are a few tips to help you stay motivated.</p>
<ol>
<li>Learn, learn, learn ‚Äì Just as you spend time learning about new programming languages, or reading about yet another tablet device. Learn about new things to eat, new exercises to try, new goals. Whatever, just maintain the excitement by learning new things.</li>
<li>Get others involved ‚Äì This generally comes naturally. When others see you getting into shape, they will most likely want to join. This can be a great motivator, especially when you are feeling burnt out. Get a workout buddy to go to the gym, run, do P90x, etc‚Ä¶ with.</li>
<li>Find healthy things to consume that don‚Äôt suck ‚Äì This is a huge challenge for people starting out. They think that they have to eat celery and chicken breasts all day. This is one thing I love about p90x. It comes with an incredibly (and delicious) diet plan including recipes. In a future post, I‚Äôm going to write about a stellar protein smoothie that I have every day.</li>
<li>Get the crap out of your house ‚Äì I‚Äôm serious, you won‚Äôt miss it. Cookies, Soda, Doughnuts, whatever‚Ä¶</li>
<li>If you want soda, drink a soda ‚Äì A can of soda is roughly 120 calories, this isn‚Äôt terrible. But don‚Äôt make it a habbit. Limit yourself and throw away your effin Big Gulp cup!</li>
<li>Eat before you leave your house ‚Äì this is huge. If you are hungry and you are out, what do you do? You go scoop up a McFeeces from McDonalds‚Ä¶ Instead, eat some lunch meat or whatever before you go run those errands.</li>
<li>Eat frequently with smaller portions ‚Äì I told my dad that I eat about 5-7 times a day, and he responded with ‚Äúyou‚Äôre going to get fat doing that‚Äù Contrary to popular belief, it is far better for you to eat more frequent, smaller meals. This is tricky when you spend the day in the office. You have to somewhat plan your day in terms of food. Bring stuff to snack on such as nuts, popcorn, protein bars, and beef jerkey.</li>
<li>Share your success ‚Äì Blog, Tweet, Facebook, Youtube. Whatever it is, tell people about it. Others will surely praise you for this, and you will most likely motivate them. Plus, it will hold you accountable.</li>
<li>Get a good water bottle and take it everywhere ‚Äì Water is a tricky thing. It‚Äôs so hard to remember to drink enough. I have found that if I have water in front of me, I will always sip on it, especially when I‚Äôm sitting at my desk all day.</li>
</ol>
<p>To wrap this up, I‚Äôm not trying to sell you on P90X or any other fitness program. I just feel that it will be a killer start and give you all of the tools needed to launch into a healthier, more fit 2011. Also, you will start seeing results very quickly.</p>

  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>My wife has this interesting problem of having vivid dreams about whatever she was last watching/discussing before bed. Last night, I was explaining to her all about memory leaks as I had a discussion with a coworker earlier in the day about them. She was curious, so I gave her a very simple explanation in which she could understand.</p>
<p>Later in the night (about 3 am), my son woke up screaming. He must have had a bad dream or something; so, I went in there, put him down and went back to bed. My wife rolls over, looks me straight in the eye and says in a groggy voice ‚ÄúDoes he have a memory leak?‚Äù</p>
<p>I laughed so hard it woke her up. I then appropriately responded with ‚ÄúI have to go take a memory leak‚Äù.</p>

  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p>With the upcoming release of the Mac App Store, I can only imagine another gold rush is upon us. Clever Indie developers making money hand over fist while the store as well as developers find their identities. With that being said, I feel that there is a serious lack of interesting (maintained) Twitter clients for OSX. I say ‚Äúmaintained‚Äù because Tweetie for OSX is just fantastic, however Twitter said they don‚Äôt have any plans for it at this time. So, I want to provide devs with the tools to create an amazing Twitter client for the Mac that I will want to use <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Quite some time ago, I began (and never completed) a series on <a href="http://brandontreb.com/objective-c-programming-tutorial-creating-a-twitter-client-part-1/">writing a Twitter client for OSX</a>. It was very well received by the development community, however once Twitter switched over to OAUTH, I became too lazy to update it <!-- raw HTML omitted --> . So, I figured a tutorial series for <a href="http://idevblogaday">#iDevBlogADay</a> would be the perfect opportunity to complete it.</p>
<p>So we are going to start from the ground up. In today‚Äôs tutorial, we are going walk through getting the initial resources and setting up Twitter to authenticate our application. We will also post a basic tweet.</p>
<h4 id="setting-up-twitter">Setting Up Twitter</h4>
<p>In order for your application to interface with Twitter, you must register it with them over at <a href="http://developer.twitter.com">http://developer.twitter.com</a>.</p>

<h4 id="getting-necessary-resources">Getting Necessary Resources</h4>
<p>I spent a bit of time researching the various options for handling OAUTH and all of the fun stuff that goes along with Twitter integration and found that <a href="https://github.com/mattgemmell/MGTwitterEngine/">MGTwitterEngine</a> was the least painful to implement. I say least painful because it has a few quirks of it‚Äôs own along with not having the best documentation in the world.</p>
<p>So after battling for a bit to get the thing compiled, I have figured out the setup process :). You could also read <a href="https://github.com/mattgemmell/MGTwitterEngine/wiki/Building-and-testing-MGTwitterEngine">Matt‚Äôs installation instructions</a>, but I will regurgitate them here a little differently and hopefully be more clear. So here it is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you have git installed. If not, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/">download it for OSX here</a>.</li>
<li>cd to the directory that you want to clone the files to</li>
<li>Clone the MGTwitterEngine repository. Type:<br>
$ <strong>git clone git://github.com/mattgemmell/MGTwitterEngine.git</strong></li>
<li>cd into the MGTwitterEngine folder (we will install the dependancies at this level)</li>
<li>Now install the dependancies (<a href="https://github.com/schwa/TouchJSON">TouchJSON</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ctshryock/oauthconsumer">OAUTHConsumer</a>). Note: There is an option to use yajl (yet another json library), but I found it a pain to integrate, so we will just throw it out.<br>
$ <strong>git clone git://github.com/schwa/TouchJSON.git</strong><br>
$ <strong>git clone git://github.com/ctshryock/oauthconsumer.git</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Altogether, this is the order of commands you should have:</p>

<h4 id="building-mgtwitterengine-what-a-freakin-pain">Building MGTwitterEngine (What a freakin pain)</h4>
<p>I find it interesting that this project is riddled with errors directly upon download. So much work went into it, yet it‚Äôs so challenging to get working.</p>
<p>Now open up MGTwitterEngine.xcodeproj. You will notice that there are quite a few missing files (they show in red). That‚Äôs fine. DELETE THEM ALL‚Ä¶</p>
<ol>
<li>Delete the <strong>yajl</strong> group with everything in it</li>
<li>Delete the <strong>Twitter YAJL Parsers</strong> group and everything in it</li>
<li>Delete <strong>OAToken_KeychainExtensions.m</strong> and <strong>OAToken_KeychainExtensions.h</strong> (they are not used)</li>
<li>Delete <strong>CJSONDataSerializer.h</strong> and <strong>CJSONDataSerializer.m</strong></li>
<li>Delete <strong>CSerializedJSONData.h</strong> and <strong>CSerializedJSONData.m</strong></li>
<li>Click the arrow on the OAuthConsumer group and you will notice that the <strong>Crypto</strong> is missing. We still need this group, but it‚Äôs in the wrong place. Delete this group and then open up your MGTwitterEngine folder in Finder. Navigate to <strong>MGTwitterEngine-&gt;oauthconsumer</strong>. Drag the <strong>Crypto</strong> folder into your project.</li>
<li>We need to change the C Language Dialect to C99. To do this right click on MGTwitterEngine in XCode and click Get Info. Scroll down to C Language Dialect and click the drop down changing it to C99<br>

<li>Finally, we need to tell MGTwitterEngine that we want to use TouchJSON instead of yajl. To do this open up <strong>MGTwitterEngineGlobalHeader.h</strong> and set TOUCHJSON_AVAILABLE to 1.</li>
<li>If you still have any hair left at this point, click Build and Run to and check out the output in the Console</li>
<li>If you don‚Äôt feel like jumping through all of these hoops you can download my MGTwitterEngine project with all of this fun stuff completed. <a href="http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/MGTwitterEngine.zip">Download it here</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="testing-mgtwitterengine">Testing MGTwitterEngine</h4>
<p>For today‚Äôs tutorial, we will just be displaying our timeline and updating our status using the demo file provided by MGTwitterEngine. In the next tutorial, we will actually be integrating the engine into a new project. So, open up <strong>AppController.m</strong> in the <strong>Demo</strong> group. Matt has given us some nice variables to fill in, in order to make this thing work. Let‚Äôs update to applicationDidFinishLaunching method to look like the code below:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<pre><code>    // Create a TwitterEngine and set our login details.
    twitterEngine = [[MGTwitterEngine alloc] initWithDelegate:self];
[twitterEngine setUsesSecureConnection:NO];
[twitterEngine setConsumerKey:consumerKey secret:consumerSecret];
[twitterEngine setUsername:username];

token = [[OAToken alloc] initWithKey:@&quot;16369316-GgqA00WO0poCAj0XAFhJYDDRthVvWMxTnVyKdfWa1&quot;
                              secret:@&quot;StrongEnoughForAManButMadeForAWoman&quot;];
[twitterEngine setAccessToken:token];
[twitterEngine getHomeTimelineSinceID:0 startingAtPage:0 count:20];
</code></pre>
<p>}&lt;/code&gt;<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So obviously I changed my consumer secret and Access Token Secret. You will need to fill this out with your information. Here is how to obtain them.</p>
<p><strong>Consumer Key &amp; Consumer Secret</strong></p>
<p>When logged into <a href="http://developer.twitter.com/apps/">http://developer.twitter.com/apps/</a> , click on the application that you created in the first step:</p>
<p><a href="http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Screen-shot-2010-12-02-at-9.51.55-PM.png"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>Scroll down and you should see the Consumer Key and the Consumer Secret.</p>
<p><a href="http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Screen-shot-2010-12-02-at-9.50.46-PM.png"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p><strong>Access Token &amp; Access Token Secret</strong></p>
<p>In the right column, you should see a link titled ‚ÄúMy Access Token‚Äù. Click on it.</p>
<p><a href="http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Screen-shot-2010-12-02-at-9.52.05-PM.png"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>Now you should see YOUR Access Token and Access Token Secret</p>
<p><a href="http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Screen-shot-2010-12-02-at-9.52.15-PM.png"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<h4 id="have-fun">Have Fun!</h4>
<p>After you copy the tokens, keys, and secrets into the app, you should be able start making calls to Twitter using the engine. Build and run the application at this point and watch your home timeline get output to the console. One thing I want to point out is we are displaying an NSDictionary. That means MGTwitterEngine did all of the parsing for us (using TouchJSON), which is super rad.</p>
<p>One more thing to try for fun is to update your status. It will even show that you updated it from YOUR application on Twitter. Add the following line and run it again.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Well, that does it for today. Join me next week when I will show you how to move the engine into your own project and we will begin displaying tweets in a basic table view.</p>
<p>Happy Coding!</p>

  </header>
  <section class="post-body">
	<p>First off, Happy Thanksgiving to my American readers. And a happy Thursday to everyone else. I‚Äôm sitting here on Thursday morning drinking coffee and eating Sticky Buns (kind of like gooey doughnuts). It‚Äôs been a hectic week of family and travel, so please forgive me if this is not the most verbose post.</p>
<p>Showing your other applications within each of your applications (wow, the word application is starting to lose meaning) can have a tremendous impact on your sales. It‚Äôs a great way to promote your other apps for free and will give them much more exposure across a wider audience. Moving all of the promotion logic out to the web allows you to dynamically add and remove apps from the view without updating your apps in the store.</p>
<p>[Insert Cool Graph Backing This Statement Up Here] //I‚Äôm not that cool yet <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>We have seen this in many popular apps. Here is a screenshot from an iDevBlogADay veteran <a href="http://www.streamingcolour.com/blog/">Owen Goss</a> promoting his other applications from inside of <a href="http://www.streamingcolour.com/games/landformer/">LandFormer</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/promo.png"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>We are going to learn how to make something similar and I will provide you with a web template as well as the view controller to load it.</p>
<h4 id="download-the-template">Download The Template</h4>
<p>So, I‚Äôm sure there are a million more ‚Äúelegant‚Äù ways to display your apps, but I went for super simple. So, 1337 web dev idevblogadayers, please go easy on me in the comments. Download the code below and look in the Web folder.</p>
<p><a href="http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/promotion2.zip">Download The Code Files Here</a></p>
<p>Here is a screenshot of what the template will look like:</p>
<p><a href="http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Screen-shot-2010-11-25-at-11.51.07-AM.png"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></p>
<p>It will also work in portrait mode.</p>
<h4 id="upload-the-template-files-to-your-web-server-and-replace-my-sample-data">Upload The Template Files To Your Web Server And Replace My Sample Data</h4>
<p>If you have your own website (which you probably should üòâ ), upload the template files to a subdirectory. If not, or you don‚Äôt want to waste bandwidth on it, you can always <a href="http://wiki.dropbox.com/TipsAndTricks/HostWebsites">host the files on Dropbox</a>.</p>
<p>Next, upload your icons (the template auto rounds the corners so you can just use the one‚Äôs bundled with your app) and replace my sample images with yours.</p>
<p>Finally, replace the URL‚Äôs with the URLs to your applications. You can also add/remove table cells to match the number of applications you are promoting.</p>
<h4 id="add-the-promotion-code-to-your-iphone-app">Add The Promotion Code To Your iPhone App</h4>
<p>Look in the iPhone folder from the unzipped file you downloaded above and copy the following 3 files into your project:</p>
<ul>
<li>PromotionViewController.m</li>
<li>PromotionViewController.h</li>
<li>PromotionViewController.xib</li>
</ul>
<p>Check the box to copy them into your project folder when prompted.</p>
<p>We will now take a look at how to display the promotion view when a button is clicked.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Make sure you set controller.promotionAddress to the web address of your promotion.html file.</p>
<p>And there you have it! When the user tapps on a button it will display our promotion view modally and will load up your promo page. I have provided a sample application that pulls up the promotion view when a button has been clicked.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or comments, feel free to leave them in the comments.</p>
<p>Happy Coding!</p>
