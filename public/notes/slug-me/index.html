Hugo is a popular, open-source static site generator that offers a lot of benefits over custom blog engines. Firstly, Hugo is much faster than custom blog engines since it generates static HTML files, which can be quickly served to users. Secondly, Hugo is more secure since there are no dynamic components that can be exploited by malicious actors. Additionally, Hugo is easier to use, as it provides a user-friendly interface for creating and managing content, and a large library of templates and themes to choose from.</p>
