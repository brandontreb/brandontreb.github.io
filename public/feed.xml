      <description>I actually enjoy when my browser crashes hard and forgets all of my open tabs that I‚Äòve been hoarding for weeks
I was never going to read that article or mess around with that code tool anyway

      <description>I‚Äôve spent months working on a blogging engine. I have always wanted to create my own ever since typing rails new blog in 2006.
I finally did it, and I realized I would still be better off using Hugo.
Oh well, lesson learned. At least I was finally able to scratch the itch.</description>

      <description>I have been super inspired by all of the posts this month about everyone&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;year in books&amp;rdquo;. I thought I was a pretty avid reading, but it turns out, I have a long way to go.
I had a pretty good mix of actually reading vs. listening to books last year. For the record, I&amp;rsquo;m a die hard Amazon Kindle fan (I know, not the best for authors, etc&amp;hellip; but I just love the form fit.</description>

      <description>For this month&amp;rsquo;s retro game, I started playing The Legend of Zelda: Link&amp;rsquo;s Awakening DX on my RG351V.
I absolutely LOVE this game and it looks gorgeous on this device.
I&amp;rsquo;ve played through most of Links Awakening on the original Gameboy hardware, however I never completed it due to the battery dying.
I&amp;rsquo;m excited to finally play it all the way through!</description>

      <description>Anyone who had participated in crypto for a significant amount of time, has a story or two about missed opportunity or even loss. This is my story.
In 2016, a client of mine asked me to build them a DApp (distributed app) on the Ethereum blockchain. At that time, ETH was trading around $100 USD per coin.
The client, being super into crypto, offered to pay me in Ethereum only.</description>

      <description>Reflections on the impact of the &amp;lsquo;4-Hour Workweek&amp;rsquo; 15 years later
They had never read it. If they did, they would have found that it is a philosophical wake-up call disguised as a bunch of life hacks. The whole book is basically him channeling the energy of poet Mary Oliver and yelling, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt waste your wild and precious life!‚Äù
When I read The 4 Hour Workweek in 2010, it had a profound impact on my life and trajectory.</description>

      <description>No, Blogging Is Not Dying Anytime Soon¬†- Darius Foroux
But still, people who read have always been in the minority. And I think that‚Äôs what most people who think that ‚Äúvideo is the future‚Äù don‚Äôt get. Sure, people are getting lazier and they want you to feed them content.

      <description>While I was still using Twitter, I set up a ton of keyword filters. This was especially true during the election seasons. I prefer using social media to connect with people and find communities surrounding my hobbies and interests.
While these filters did an ok job, they often times had false positives and filtered out content that I was actually interested in. An example of this might be a filter on the word Trump.</description>

      <description>There are so many beautiful moments every single day that I get to share with my kids.
I was reminded of this today as I looked in my rear view mirror and watched my daughter sing along to her favorite Taylor Swift song.

      <description>With the rise of ChatGPT and other AI text interfaces, there emerges a new issue called Prompt Leakage. For these systems to work well, a carefully crafted prompt must be entered in order to give the AI very specific directions.
A prompt might be something as simple as &amp;ldquo;How many calories are in an apple?&amp;rdquo;, or it might be something much more complex (see below).
Lately, many startups have capitalized on these AI text systems and the &amp;ldquo;wizard behind the curtain&amp;rdquo; appears to be a super secret prompt.</description>

      <description>So, it looks like @paul@tapbots.social has confirmed that Twitter is shutting down API keys for 3rd party apps.
In addition to this change, they have completely removed the ability to sort the timeline chronologically. That was the only feature that made Twitter somewhat usable.
In light of these changes, I have finally begun the process of downloading my archived Twitter data and moving off for good.</description>

      <description>Over the years, I have tried many Aeropress methods for making coffee. After many variations, I have found this one to be the best and most consistent.
Recipe Method: inverted Beans: 30g (usually Ethiopian) Grind: course Water: 200g Time: 60s Instructions Start heating the water in a kettle. While the water is heating, grind 30g of coffee in the grinder and pour it into the inverted Aeropress.
Place the Aeropress on the scale, pour in 100g of water, and stir.</description>

      <description>Snowboarding was a bust today.
We drove all the way up the Santa Fe Ski Area (1.5 hours from my house) only to turn around and head home.
The line to rent was over an hour long and the lift lines were nuts! I have never seen it that busy.
We‚Äôll try again next week‚Ä¶</description>

      <description>@manton I have a few questions/notes about non microblog hosted sites (mine now supports webmention and microformats) and m.b integration.
When I reply from my domain,it doesn‚Äôt link to my user on m.b. Even though my domain is associated with it. It creates a new m.b. user named brandontreb.com instead of showing it from my @brandontreb account. When replying, should I sent a webmention to m.b. Or the users custom domain?</description>

BTW, your blog has been a huge source of inspiration. I have spent the last 6 months building an indie web-centric single-user blog engine (my site is currently running it). Your tools (Im currently posting on Quill) and documentation have been absolutely invaluable!</description>

      <description>My router decided to die a couple days ago. Needless to say, our &amp;ldquo;Smart Home&amp;rdquo; became pretty dumb without a solid internet connection. I just got the Eero system setup and am very happy with it so far.</description>

      <description>My good friends Denver and Ray recently opened a cigar shop called Padres.
The name is super clever as they both are/were pastors of local churches.
It‚Äôs such a good way to get together with friends, hang out and have great discussions.</description>

      <description>I have recently been experimenting with [Morning Pages](The Artist&#39;s Way Morning Pages Journal: A Companion Volume to the Artist&#39;s Way https://a.co/d/aB5Fi7e) on the recommendation of Tim Ferris.
I‚Äôm not sure that I can stick with it as strongly encourages hand-written pages. My hands cramp up so quickly and I write so small, the journaling takes almost an hour to complete.
Does anyone have any suggestions on a journaling technique that has worked for you (digital or physical)?</description>

      <description>‚ÄúWeird Al‚Äù Yankovic
What an incredible experience bringing my oldest son to this concert. Weird Al truly does span the generations.
This was the funniest and most quirky concert I have ever been to.</description>

      <description>A few months back, I purchased an Anbernic RG351v handheld emulator.
I couldn‚Äôt be happier with it. It has been an absolute joy to play the games from my childhood.
There are so many NES and SNES games that I started, but could never complete when I was a kid. This little device is a joy to revisit them on.
Starting last month, I convinced my buddy Will to buy one as well and we started a monthly retro gaming club.</description>

      <description>I just saw a message today that Github is going to start charging for Co Pilot. While this bums me out, it definitely saves me more than $10/month in time.
Cp Pilot has become an integral part of my workflow and saves me hours of Stack Overflow research as well as time spent copying and pasting of boilerplate code.</description>

      <description>Every day that we lived in the bus was experimental. We had new adventures, new ideas, as well as lots of troubleshooting. I often miss those days, but am really grateful for the home we have built. Living in 320 square ft for 3 years for a family got pretty tight.</description>

      <description>I LOVE the idea of taking modern web apps to the Terminal. As a heavy user of ssh, tmux, screen, etc&amp;hellip; the idea of seldom leaving the terminal seems very romantic.
There was a recent Show HN Post about a small app called lists.sh that really caught my attention.
The first very interesting aspect of this technology is it uses Public Key Cryptography to establish user accounts. No emails, no passwords, high security.</description>

      <description>I have never seen micro.blog so active. It must be because of The Great Twitter Exodus. I understand the hate for Musk, however I don&#39;t understand how him buying the company makes it any worse.

      <description>Apple says they&#39;re removing my game because it&#39;s more than 2 years old
This HN thread really resonated with me. I have been building and publishing iOS apps since the dawn of the App Store in 2008. In those 14 years, I have shipped over 200 apps, and do you want to know how many are still in the App Store? Zero.
Some of these takedowns are due to startups failing or clients deciding to go in another direction, but still quite a few are forced out due to Apple‚Äôs update policy.</description>

      <description>I‚Äôve always loved the phrase:
&amp;gt; ‚ÄúChop your own wood and it will warm you twice‚Äù
From a figurative stance about hard work, but also literally. When I want a fire outside, I begin splitting wood. By the time I‚Äôm done, I‚Äôm always way too warm to want to actually light it.</description>

      <description>Another shot from our camping trip this weekend. This is McCauley Hot Springs. The water comes out of the mountain at 100¬∞ F. It‚Äôs about a 3 mile hike from the road. Definitely worth it.</description>

      <description>Some young punks overheard me talking about JavaScript at lunch today. They felt it necessary to come to my table and tell me ‚Äútypescript is waybetter‚Äù. They don‚Äôt realize that this sort of thing screams ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a junior developer! I know very little about the tech industry!‚Äù
If you are a newer developer, learn early that you are greatly limiting your potential by marrying a subset of programming languages. You will greatly increase your value by being open to learning and building in any language that is best suited for the project.</description>

      <description>I&#39;m deep in Kotlin dev now and I find it to be much like Android itself. It&#39;s very functional, but lacks overall polish and sexiness. It often provides functionality that I didn&#39;t ask for, yet makes it extremely difficult to perform tasks that would be otherwise trivial in iOS.</description>

      <description>When I first started consulting, I had everything tied to my name. My company name was Treb Studios, my email was brandon@brandontreb.com, and my whole business was tied to me.
This was fine for a while&amp;hellip;until I started growing. I hired contractors with the intention of replacing myself on my existing projects. This proved to be very challenging.
Clients didn‚Äôt want other developers, they wanted Brandon, because that‚Äôs what they were promised.</description>

      <description>Tonight, I&#39;m going to a party for local entrepreneurs.
I was getting ready for the party and thinking about the signals I am sending with every detail I put into my appearance. How do I want to be perceived? Should I go combover or faux-hawk, slacks or jeans, watch or Fitbit, leather or suit jacket? All of these decisions don&#39;t necessarily paint the picture of Brandon, so much as they paint the picture of who Brandon wants you to believe he is.</description>

      <description>I have really been enjoying listening to Darknet Diaries lately. It‚Äôs a Podcast about hacks and software security vulnerabilities.
The show really makes me realize how crappy and insecure most software is. Most importantly, it has gotten me much more security-minded in the software that I build.
If you aren‚Äôt already listening to it, I‚Äôd suggest you check it out. You will soon put on your tin foil hat like me and start to believe everybody is trying to hack you.</description>

      <description>My wife and I are hard core ‚Äútype-a‚Äù people. I mean, so planned that we send each other calendar invites for date night (don‚Äôt judge what we consider romantic ;)).
I didn‚Äôt used to be like this. When I was younger and in college, I was a total scatter brain, a C student by choice.
This all changed the day I was laid off and had to start my own company.</description>

      <description>I absolutely hate scoping projects. It&#39;s such uninteresting / uninspiring work.
It&#39;s ironic because scoping generally translates to work/dollars, so it&#39;s a critical part of my business.
Also, I can&#39;t outsource this task. I don&#39;t trust anyone to do it correctly and accurately</description>

      <description>Many of you might not know this, but my family and I live in a converted schoolbus.
Today, I had quite a few ‚Äúbus chores‚Äù and I figured that I would share them here because together, they do seem a bit odd.
Change composting toilet Fill up propane tanks Add heat tape to fresh water lines Replace RV vent in roof because it started leaking Sometimes I wonder if I have more chores on the bus than in a traditional home.</description>

      <description>The other day, I was having a conversation over Slack with my development team. They were working on a client project (and doing a killer job), and there was a particular UX pattern that seemed very unintuitive to me. This app was designed by the client, so there was little the dev team could do beyond making suggestions, so they went ahead and implemented it per the spec.
After fiddling around with it for a few minutes, I literally couldn&#39;t understand how to complete the particular task and had to ask the team lead for some help.</description>

If you don‚Äôt already know about him, I‚Äôd suggest starting at the beginning and reading through all of his posts.

      <description>My little brother was recently in town for the holidays. He‚Äôs about to graduate from college with a CS degree, so naturally we talked about searching for a job.
I figured I would share the advice I gave to him here in hopes that it might help others.
Don‚Äôt be discouraged when you get turned down. Having hired many employees over the years, I have learned that there are so many reasons to not hire a candidate.</description>

      <description>As developers, we spend so much time perfecting our craft. We are always on the hunt for hacks, tips, and tweaks.
We always set out to write the most clever and reusable code possible. This is all great&amp;hellip;until it‚Äôs time to ship.
I have seen it time after time. Developers over-optimizing their code, writing protocol after protocol. All the while, they slip further and further behind schedule.
When the client asks the dev about the delay on feature X, the dev proceeds to explain the super cool reusable, component-driven,state managed, highly available, future proof, buzzword, buzzword system they are creating.</description>

      <description>In our house, we often joke that ‚Äúthe diet starts Monday‚Äù. Usually, this is in response to some conclusion that we are not currently on the healthiest path.
Procrastination is in our DNA. We put everything off until the absolute last minute. For me, it‚Äôs usually side projects. Projects that I know will make some revenue to supplement some of my consulting income. It‚Äôs my goal to eventually move on from consulting, however that has been on my ‚Äúresolution list‚Äù for years, with little progress.</description>

      <description>It‚Äôs often much easier to have a sense of gratitude when things are going well. As humans, we are prone to focusing on the one bad thing that‚Äôs going wrong rather than the multitude of good things going right. This traces way back to a time where we needed this sense to stay away from danger.
My father-in-law was just admitted to the hospital with lukeumia. Although this is one of the harder times in our family‚Äôs lives, it‚Äôs really been a sobering experience giving me a stronger sense of gratitude for my wife and kids.</description>

      <description>‚ÄúJust hack a quick proof of concept, we‚Äôll rebuild it when we get more funding.‚Äù These are some words I often hear from clients who have minimal budgets.
They generally want my team to build something small/quick/cheap to get their concept across in hopes of securing more funds down the road.
What I have learned by saying ‚Äúyes‚Äù to these types of requests in the past is, those quickly hacked prototypes often end up in production.</description>

Whenever I get a cold email from someone local, it‚Äôs a different story. I always feel sorry for them. They have totally missed an opportunity to connect with someone in real life and possibly a sale.</description>

      <description>It&#39;s been around 3 weeks since I started blogging every weekday. This experience has been nothing short of delightful.
While I have seen many improvements in my communication (written and verbal), I believe the best benefit is around the community.
When I started blogging in 2008, my posts used to have upwards of 100 comments. Granted I was a renegade blogging about iOS in a time of Apple&#39;s dreaded NDA. I absolutely loved the feedback and the community that was forming around my writing.</description>

      <description>I was recently listening to Episode 344- 10 Strategies To Be Happier Through Gratitude on the Tim Ferris Show. Oddly enough, I much prefer episodes where Tim is absent. I do love him, but sometimes feels he steals the conversation.
Anyway, the episode was hosted by a guy named A.J. Jacobs. Jacobs wrote a book on gratitude and is known for traveling the world to thank over 1,000 people involved in his morning coffee (think farmer, roaster, truck driver, etc&amp;hellip;).</description>

      <description>I had the amazing opportunity today to hit File -&amp;gt; New Project today. There are few feelings in the world as great as the optimism that comes from starting a brand new project.
‚ÄúThis one will be different‚Äù, I murmur to myself. ‚ÄúI will keep it clean, organized, and free from hacks. ‚Äú, I cheerfully gloat.
Why is it that it‚Äôs so hard to follow through on this philosophy? I said it yesterday, coding is hard.</description>

      <description>I have been building software for clients for over a decade now and have come to one solid conclusion: deliveries suck.
Maybe I&#39;m just the worst developer in the world and have worked with the worst teams and have had the worst clients‚Ä¶ but I doubt it.
I have delivered early, on time, late, with more functionality, exactly the same, and in some cases less functionality (usually due to lack of funding) and still‚Ä¶rough deliveries.</description>

      <description>I was having a conversation with my dad the other day and sharing some of my current business ideas with him. I also mentioned that I often discuss new product/business ideas in public with other people.
His response was obviously ‚ÄúWhy would you just give away your ideas?‚Äù. I then proceeded to give him the &amp;quot;Your Ideas Are Worthless Without Proper Execution‚Äù spiel.
So, to put my money where my mouth is, I will be sharing my business ideas here; putting them out there in hopes that either a.</description>

      <description>When I was in high school, I used to think computers were for nerds. I was a skater obsessed with chasing girls with no time for computers.
It wasn‚Äôt until a buddy of mine convinced me to take a Visual Basic 6 class with him, that I realized that I was one of those ‚Äúnerds‚Äù.
Quickly, I fell in love. The first ‚Äúapp‚Äù that I ever completed was a game that raced various animal sprites found online using a random number generator.</description>

      <description>Rates are a weird thing and chances are, yours are too low.
I spent years stressing about rates. I would always start strong and but then eventually get talked down (usually by myself).
I think rates go hand in hand with impostor sybdrom. ‚ÄúWhy would anyone pay me that much‚Äù. It took me quite some time to over come this, however after many years, and multiple rate hikes, we are doing more business than ever.</description>

      <description>People often tell me things like &amp;quot;it must be nice to work for yourself‚Äù, or ‚ÄúI&#39;m working hard to make someone else rich&amp;quot;.
Having spent many years working for a company prior to starting my own, I can honestly say I would never want a boss again. However, I that doesn&#39;t stop me from frequently daydreaming about just how nice that would be.
The idea that having someone tell you what to do, give you a set schedule, allow you to clock out at the end of the day all sound so liberating.</description>

      <description>A few years back, when the company was growing particularly quickly, I made a decision to hire my friends. Although, I had been warned by many others that this was a bad idea, I was sure that I was going to do things differently.
I was going to have a management layer over my closest friends and then they could have the uncomfortable conversations should they arise.
Needless to say, this strategy worked for a time, however at some point, things got tough and I had to make some serious decisions.</description>

      <description>If you are a mobile developer in 2018, and are not consulting (at least on the side), you are missing out on a huge stream of revenue.
In the early days of mobile app development (2008/2009), it was fairly easy for an iOS or Android developer to get a gig with large companies (Food Network, ESPN, huge list of other names‚Ä¶). At that time, mobile was so new, that none of these companies had internal resources to support this budding vertical.</description>

      <description>I have been obsessed with Seth Godin lately. I&#39;ve been reading his books, listening to his podcasts, and devouring his blog posts.
It&#39;s amazing how he can just pump out wisdom day after day and speak so articulately on just about any subject. Some of his posts are incredibly insightful while others might seem like a small thought that just popped into his head. He doesn&#39;t seem to differentiate the two and that&#39;s incredible.</description>

      <description>Seth Godin recently discussed in an episode of the Tim Ferris Show a fear many of us have of the future. He used the example of him landing speaking gigs in which he was more apt to compromise and take gigs he didn‚Äôt particularly want on months in which no gigs were currently booked.
As someone in the consulting space, I can absolutely identify with this. In the past, I have taken clients in knowing very well that they will mostly be problematic (funding, difficult, or otherwise).</description>

      <description>I just had a realization that I‚Äôm a professional dream crusher. Being in software consulting, I hear multiple pitches every single week for all sorts of different software. While it‚Äôs not necessarily my job to tell people what‚Äôs good and bad, I feel it‚Äôs my responsibility to at least give them all of the information I can.
In my many years of doing this, I have learned a bit about what works and what doesn‚Äôt and I have gotten pretty good at saying no to projects that I don‚Äôt believe in.</description>

      <description>I have always loved the C programming language. I remember being a young programmer (man that was 15 years ago) when I wrote my first C program. It seemed like absolute magic (and it still does).
Since then, I love (re)discovering the language every chance I get.
I found this post incredibly well done with some great examples. I wish we had resources like this &amp;quot;back in my day‚Äù.

      <description>Over the past few months, I have had the pleasure of working on a DApp called thisorthat.io built on the Ethereum network. It has been an absolute blast. I have had so much fun building the smart contracts as well as the React front-end interface.
I truly believe there is a huge future here, and it can be especially lucrative for developers/startup teams. If you look at Dapp Radar, you can see that many of the top DApps have less than 1,000 DAU (daily active users).</description>

      <description>I‚Äôd say that my least favorite part about software development consulting is writing proposals.
Though they are critical to my sales process, etc‚Ä¶ I always feel like they are such a drag and it literally takes me all day to write a proposal that should take 1 hour.
Anyone else?</description>

      <description>tl;dr: micro.blog is pretty cool.
I have recently been thinking about my process of blogging / tweeting / facebooking / etc.. and have realized that I&amp;rsquo;m burnt out on all three. I LOVE to write. I started one of the first successful iOS Blogs, published numerous (software development books)[http://manning.com/trebitowski], and have been blogging since 2008. Here are a bit of thoughts about the various platforms and ultimately my solution.

      <description>In 2008, I was still in college. I had just landed my first job with a small consultancy as their first iOS developer replacing their outsourced Ukrainian team. Within my first week on the job, the CEO asked me to jump on a sales call as the technical lead. This absolutely terrified me. I remember doing things like ensuring that I had a full glass of water so my throat wouldn&amp;rsquo;t get so dry (it still did).</description>

      <description>As developers, we hear the echo chamber on Hacker News and others shouting at us to raise our rates. We are worth it. In theory they are right, we are worth it and we should be charging an industry standard rate. However, there are some instances when it&amp;rsquo;s OK to lower your rates.
Here are 3 times when you should consider lowering your rates:

      <description>Over at Pixegon, I really try to encourage my developers to have their own side projects. Often times, employers look at side projects as competition and try to own the works that their developers produce. Some will even go as far as to include this in their employee handbooks.
In my opinion, this stifles creativity and creates a feeling of contention between the employee and company.
People start side projects all of the time for a variety of reasons:</description>

It was something to the effect of &amp;ldquo;The internet levels the playing field, so someone without a job is without excuse&amp;rdquo;. Not shortly after I hit &amp;ldquo;Tweet&amp;rdquo;, did I receive an array of Tweets back from people I highly respected. I was immediately humbled, and it was pointed out to me that I had a severe lack of empathy.</description>

      <description>Want to jump ship and be a software development consultant? This post will detail why this path¬†is a much more fulfilling and safer path than a traditional job.
After interviewing quite a few developers in the consulting space, I quickly realized that this is a very common story. If you work for a company, they can usually let you go at any time for any reason. Given that this is your sole source of income, you are now in an extremely risky situation.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s late, you have been hacking all night to get the client a build. Finally, around 2:30 am, you hit submit and publish something to the client and go to bed. When you wake up in the morning, the first thing you see in your inbox is an email titled &amp;ldquo;Completely Broken!!1!&amp;rdquo;.
How could this be? You stayed up late, you hacked, you tested and you sweat over this build to find that it crashes for the client when they try to do something obvious.</description>

      <description>There is a familiar phrase that I hear all too often when a client comes to me with an existing application. It goes something like this:
‚ÄúOur team spent quite a bit of money on our application and we don‚Äôt want to ship it. We are not proud of the product.‚Äù
It blows my mind that many developers and development teams are still in business given the poor quality of products that I see getting churned out all of the time.</description>

      <description>During my years of mobile development, I have heard the phrase ‚ÄúI have an idea for an app!‚Äù hundreds, if not thousands of times. Sometimes it would be from family members, sometimes my dentist during a cleaning,¬†and sometimes from a naked dude standing in the sauna at the gym. Everyone pitches app ideas to me.
What I have learned from hearing so many pitches is this: apps really fall into one of three (sometimes four) categories.</description>

      <description>It cannot be overstated that writing down one‚Äôs goals is critical to acheiving them. Pair that with sharing them with others who might help keep you accountable and your probabilty of achieving those goals goes way up.
With this in mind, I have decided to share my 2015 goals here on my blog in hopes that I will do a better job of acheiving them in the new year. I tried to focus on more measurable goals rather than things like ‚Äúeat better‚Äù and ‚Äúexercise more‚Äù.</description>

      <description>One of the most common questions I get from software consultants is whether or not to accept fixed bid contracts. In this post, I‚Äôm hoping to shed some light on fixed bid vs. time and materials contracts and help you make the best decision for the project at hand.
Let‚Äôs start with some definitions to help you better understand what I am talking about.
A fixed bid contract is a contract where the developer and the client agree on a price and/or timeline up front for a particular contract.</description>

      <description>When I first started out as an independent software developer, one of things that stressed me out the most was how to structure contracts that I sent to clients. Working for a consultancy in my previous work-life I had seen contracts before, however, I never really paid enough attention to them to know what type of content went into them.
After quite a bit of research, I found an invaluable resource.</description>

      <description>Very frequently, I receive emails that go something like this:
‚ÄúHey Brandon, I have a killer project idea. Do you want to work on it? Please sign the NDA so we can talk.‚Äù
Early on when I first started consulting, I would have responded with something like ‚ÄúSure send it over!‚Äù and signed the thing without hesitation. As of late, I have changed my view on NDAs; at least in this type of situation.</description>

      <description>I recently published a post about my first year of being an independent iPhone development consultant. The feedback from my readers was incredible, however there was one important thread on Hacker News that I wanted to address. The issues were:
One of my common hangups with these kind of posts is the lack of history as to what lead people to these consulting gigs.¬†Where were you before, and how long were you there?</description>

      <description>Wow, I can‚Äôt believe it has already been a full year since I struck it out on my own. Last year, I published a post after my first month on doing contract iOS development. Needless to say, I have grown and learned quite a bit over the past year and I wanted to share some of those experiences.
Income While I won‚Äôt share exact numbers, I left my 6 figure/year job to pursue the indie/consulting life.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the second part of my tutorial series ‚ÄúCreating An Image Gallery Like Over‚Äù. In this part of the tutorial, you will learn how to actually display the photos in the UICollectionView as well as give the user the ability to take photos with their camera.
If you haven‚Äôt already done so, please go back and complete part 1.

      <description>Recently, I have had to build an app (download link) that required the user to choose a photo from their photo library. Rather than just throwing up a¬†UIImagePickerController like many apps, I decided to add a little bit of style. Being inspired by Over‚Äôs ultra simplistic (and beautiful) photo selection interface, I decided to fancy things up a bit.
For this tutorial, I will start with a Fresh iOS6 View-Based application that uses Storyboards and ARC.</description>

      <description>I wrote my very first blog post back in July of 2008¬†when I start iCodeBlog.com. I started the blog because I saw a huge need for iOS development tutorials on the web and really wanted to help others as I progressed in my development.
Well, quite a bit has changed since then. I have written books, spoken at conferences, and built and shipped over 40 iOS applications. Since selling iCodeblog in 2009, I have really let my passion for blogging fizzle.</description>

      <description>Welcome Hacker News! There‚Äôs some discussion happening in the comments; but, as always, the better conversation is on the article page on Hacker News itself.
Since going Indie, I am constantly asked about what software tools I use to facilitate the process. People are always curious about invoicing, time tracking, ticket management, etc‚Ä¶
The purpose of this post is two fold. First, I want to educate others on some of the cool tools I have found that have helped me out tremndously.</description>

      <description>tl;dr Present yourself to potential clients as if you have already made it. Don‚Äôt be scared, the work it out there. Freelancing FTW!1!
In the first week of December, I got a rather unfortunate (and unexpected) call from the CEO of the company I was working for. The gist of it was ‚Äúwe are reorganizing, and have decided to cut your position. Effective Immediately‚Äù. At this point, I was the Director Of Mobile Engineering and was making a very decent salary.</description>

      <description>As I mature as a developer, I try to rely on other people‚Äôs code more an more. Why build something from scratch when a solution already exists that you can fit in your project. In Pocket MUD Pro, I used 13 3rd party libraries and am using quite a bit more in the project that I‚Äôm currently working on. I figured that I would share some of the libraries that I have been using so that it might save you some time in the future.</description>

      <description>I have just updated my MUD client [Pocket MUD Pro] to be a universal library. It was surprisingly easy to add the iPad support as most of the application was comprised of UITableViews.
The main ‚ÄúMUD‚Äù view was the most challenging part as it contains a couple UIWebViews, UIButons, and a UITextField. However, I chose to do something I feel is pretty cool.
Scripting The UI With Lua If I haven‚Äôt said it enough, I love lua.</description>

      <description>We believe that developers should have the freedom to price their games how they like, without interference from the online stores that sell the games. Why? Because it allows us to promote our games more freely, as we are doing here! We rely on the ability to promote our games for our livelihood and control over pricing is an important tool for this purpose.
Because We May is doing something very incredible here.</description>

MetaWatch has been around for quite some time now and looks *ok *, however their latest update appears to be completely in response to Allerta‚Äôs announcement/success of Pebble.</description>

      <description>A while back, my buddy seantron showed me some of his 3D games he‚Äôd been working on including this one. My initial reaction was ‚Äúhow the heck did he get the chopps to do that?‚Äù. While, Sean is an incredible developer with a ton of creativity, doing things like loading models, texture mapping, or even basic 3D projects are flippin hard.
A while back I tried my hand at 3D and made sort of a basic Minecraft style game from scratch using OpenGL ES.</description>

Burnout I was blogging very consistently for the Envato Network on their Mobile Tuts Plus as well as on iCodeBlog and here.</description>

      <description>I used to be an Emacs guy and would battle to the death on the war between Vim and Emacs. It wasn‚Äôt until a coworker of mine sat down and really showed me just how cool/simple/powerful Vim can be. Just using Vim is a new adventure every day and has really improved my productivity. I now use it to code, blog, and even jot down quick notes.
Last week, I saw on Hacker News a link announcing Vim has been ported to iOS.</description>

      <description>As of OSX Lion, I have started to seriously loathe some of the build-it Mac apps (such as Mail, and iCal). While I previously had no issues with them, they now seem to be very clunky and crash quite often. Being a developer, I thought ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt I write an app that wraps web apps for you so you basically get ‚Äúnative web apps‚Äù that have icons and are launchable?‚Äù.</description>

      <description>tl;dr; Don‚Äôt buy a Kindle Fire for your kid until they resolve the parental control issues. Wifi password protection is their current solution, and it sucks.
Like many parents, I thought it would be a good idea to get a tablet device for my son so that he could play some educational games and watch some Netflix (in moderation of course). After doing quite a bit of research, I settled on the Kindle Fire.</description>

      <description>Recently, I was pretty humbled when a post of mine titled WordPress To Jekyll And Back Again made it to the front page of Hacker News. I was a little down on Jekyll for the reasons listed in that post and was feeling pretty good about my WordPress install.
At the time, I was running my own virtual instance on Rackspace cloud hosting (we‚Äôll get to this momentarily). I also had all of the caching and optimization plugins installed and welcomed the Hacker News traffic.</description>

I have also minimized my set up to save blogging costs (I now blog for FREE) and to simplify things greatly. Here is my new setup:

Using this in your project is as easy as calling:

      <description>With all of the buzz around the iTether App, I figured I‚Äôd offer a more permanent solution since Apple will surely yank this soon
Last year, a developer published his code for an http SOCKS proxy called iProxy. This will give your iPhone the ability to create a SOCKS server in which your laptop can connect to via the Bonjur protocol.
Once connect, all of your computer‚Äôs http traffic will be routed through the server on your iPhone essentially giving you free tethering.</description>

I have added iAds to my cocos2D project and when the iAds fail to serve (which is about 75% of the time), I replace them with Admob ads.</description>

Here were a few of my favorite parts:

Well, it was quite a run, but in the end I decided to revert back to WordPress. Although Jekyll is much faster than WordPress, here were my issues:

It was a pretty simple app that allowed you to add dynamic data (such as weather) to your wallpaper and save it back out to your camera roll. The idea is to improve the functionality of the user‚Äôs lockscreen. It did very well on launch (and even made it to #1 in the Israel App Store). At the peak, I was selling about 600 copies per day.</description>

      <description>Have you ever seen a game (such as Tiny Tower) that contains similar sprites that only vary by certain attributes (coloring, shading, accessories, etc‚Ä¶)? I would often wonder how long it would take the artists to create each permutation of these sprites. After discovering that you can call a method on a CCSprite called setColor, I realized how most of this customization is done in code.

As with all iOS (tech books really), my book was almost outdated the moment it hit the shelves due to Apple‚Äôs constant SDK release cycle. My book ended with ‚Äúhere is what‚Äôs coming in iOS 4‚Ä¶‚Äù, and didn‚Äôt hit the shelves until after iOS 4 was released.</description>

      <description>This post is a continuation from my previous post found here.
A MobileSubstrate Tweak? After I completed a basic app that allowed me to send various notification types from my iPhone to my inPulse watch, I quickly realized that this would not work if I wanted to hook into the iPhone‚Äôs notification system. A Google search revealed to me that I had to make MobileSubstrate hack to overwrite the default notification functionally.</description>

What is the inPulse Watch? For those of you who don‚Äôt know, the inPulse watch is a programmable wristwatch with a bluetooth controller. It can run a single app at a time on top of it‚Äôs firmware that is installed on the watch via a bluetooth interface with your computer.</description>

      <description>Developing for jailbroken is actually quite similar to regular iOS development with one addition. More Power! oh oh oh (said in a Tim Taylor voice (sorry for non-Americans that don‚Äôt get the reference)). With your device jailbroken, you have the ability to hook in to pretty much every class that Apple writes allowing you quite a bit of control over the iPhone‚Äôs functionality.
In today‚Äôs tutorial, I will simply be discussing the best way to get up and running with the tools necessary to write a jailbroken iPhone app.</description>

      <description>As of recent I have had a ton of interest in doing development for Jailbroken iPhones. I love the power, being able to hack anything on the device. It opens up a whole new world of possibilities.
My most current project (inPulseNotifier) is a Mobile Substrate hack which allows the iPhone to interface with an inPulse watch. It uses BTStack and boots up during the init method of your springboard.</description>

      <description>Well, I have finally made the switch from WordPress to Jekyll and couldn‚Äôt be happier. Here are some of the bonuses I have seen thus far.
SPEED: Just click around on my site. It is screaming fast now. Resources: Checking top on my server reveals that I have a TON of extra resources (which makes sense since Jekyll sites are way more lightweight). Ease of blogging: Ok, WordPress was pretty easy too, however, I was really starting to get sick of the post interface.</description>

      <description>So, after my 6 year relationship with WordPress, I have been having some strong feelings for another (blog engine). Jekyll does everything that I want my wordpress to do.
Not suck at security Not be bloated Not have a sucky post editor Expense ‚Äì I have a few blogs hosted on Rackspace and my bill has gotten pretty pricey. I‚Äôm hoping to host my Jekyll site on App Engine for frizzle (free).</description>

      <description>Perhaps this already exists, if so, please link me to it.
The idea
Drop music into your Dropbox folder on your computer. Then open up the app which presents you with an iPod like interface for this music.
The genius
What‚Äôs great about it is, you have all of you music on your iPhone without using up disk space. Of course you may need to upgrade your Dropbox account to something greater than 2GBs to see any real value.</description>

      <description>My latest iOS app, Smart Lockscreen Creator has just released on iPhone for $.99.

The Idea Currently your lockscreen on your iOS device is nothing more than a pretty watch with a background. Jailbreakers have solved this issue with an incredible application called intelliscreen, which adds lots of interesting information to it. However, you and I are Apple fanboys and won‚Äôt violate our precious iPhones with jailbreaking. Enter Smart Lockscreen Creator.</description>

Two months seems like a relatively short time to prepare, especially for my first ‚Äúreal‚Äù run, however I am just aiming to finish rather than being competitive.</description>

Seeing someone‚Äôs work area is especially inspring to me, I love seeing where others create and what they surround themselves with for inspiration and motivation.</description>

      <description>Intro This is my first #iDevBlogADay post and I wanted to give a quick intro before jumping in. My name is Brandon Trebitowski and I‚Äôm a software developer and author from Albuquerque, New Mexico. I graduated from the University of New Mexico in 2008 with a bachelors degree in computer science. For the past 2 years, I have been writing mobile applications (primarily for the iPhone) for ELC Technologies.

      <description>One thing I always wondered about Core Data is why the compiler would warn you if you didn‚Äôt specify the inverse relationship. After reading through Apple‚Äôs docs, they essentially say its to make your database more robust by reinforcing those relationships. Plus, you never know when you may have one thing and need to get to the other.
After working on a project with an Enormous Core Data database, I found one very useful thing about inverses.</description>

      <description>This article was a very interesting with some insight into the Android Market. Basically, this indie Android developer has published 6 free applications and is making more than $1,000.00 per month off of advertisements.
None of my apps has been ever promoted in Top of Android Market
I am providing only free apps (mostly due of Android Market limitations)
Even if I would be able to sell apps I would not use it as main income source‚Ä¶ (I believe that you still can make more from ads‚Ä¶)</description>

      <description>Here is a great article about some advice given to a 22 year old starting his life journey. These points are applicable to anyone, but found them especially applicable to software developers in general.

Here are a few that I particularly enjoyed
Do not ever work
Picasso used to paint all the time, Henry Moore sculpt the whole day. Others would have thought they were working themselves to death. They actually were reenergizing and reinvigorating themselves.</description>

Texturing Lighting Skybox Better Terrain generation Environment Fog Basic navigation So judging by the screenshot, you might really be thinking that I‚Äôm working on Minecraft for the iPhone (I used textures that someone created for Minecraft).

      <description>After a week of studying my butt off with OpenGL ES, I have finally started work on my game engine for my Pov‚Äôs Challenge game.
As you can tell from the screenshot below, I have been playing entirely too much Minecraft and have cube art on the brain.
It‚Äôs not much right now, but I do have a basic cube rendering engine that takes in a level file and renders the environment.</description>

      <description>Ok, so maybe this is stupid, reposting your own content in multiple areas. As far as SEO goes, it may not be the best idea. However, I really love Tumblr and I really love WordPress. I can‚Äôt seem to part with either yet I don‚Äôt quite have the time for both.
I put out a quick tweet earlier today (and this is why I flippin love Twitter), asking if anyone knew of a good way to connect WordPress to Twitter.</description>

      <description>I really enjoyed this article on traits of developers.
http://www.turnleafdesign.com/6-traits-of-successful-developers
In my experience, developers tend to become arrogant and totally ignore #1 (see Windows Devs). I feel that this is the most important trait of all.
‚ÄúFor a developer to be successful over any period of time a continued commitment to learning is absolutely vital. The field is too large, too quickly changing, and too in depth for any developer to ever ‚Äúknow it all.</description>

‚ÄúJust put up a few tags that state (in this order) Rails, Coding, Consulting, Porn, Free Porn, Porn on Rails, Viagra, iPhone, development, hot chicks, elc.
Guaranteed hits!‚Äù
Genius right? So after a while, a fellow employee (@maxmurphy) suggested we implement this rails solution:
Perfect!

Over the past couple of days, I have been receiving the following error when trying to add my blog to the iPhone app.
After scouring the internet, I found that this could be the result of a few issues.
Special characters in a post body that are not supported by NSXMLParser Special characters in a comment Invalid post or comment RSS An error in a theme/plugin file For me, this turned out to be an issue with the comments RSS feed.</description>

      <description>I have updated my WordPress plugin Feedburner Anywhere. In case you are unfamiliar with it, it‚Äôs a plugin that allows you to output your Feedburner subscriber count anywhere on your blog.
**The Problem: **Since Google took over Feedburner, I feel that it has been quite unreliable. A few times a week, Feedburner would return 0 for your subscriber count. This was an issue with the plugin. If the return value was 0 when the plugin pulled and cached the feedburner data, you would look like you had no subscribers.</description>

      <description>The script to do this is actually quite simple and can be used to update any post attribute.
Here is the code:
This will assign the keywords ‚Äúfoo‚Äù, ‚Äúbar‚Äù, and ‚Äúbaz‚Äù to the post with ID 5. This task seems trivial, however it‚Äôs very powerful when you think about automation. For example, you could write a script to scrape a google search for your target keyword and find related keywords for each of your posts automatically.</description>

The Problem As you may have discovered, the wp_query() function isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúone size fit‚Äôs all‚Äù solution. Often times, you may need to query the WordPress database using a custom MySQL query. Especially if you are using WordPress for anything other than a blog (ie freshapps.</description>

      <description>With the success of the Apple App Store, it seems that everyone is wanting a piece of the pie.
Amazon is now looking to throw their hat into the ring and is releasing their own dev kit for their ever so popular Kindle.
http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html/?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;docId=1000476231
It appears that big name game developers Electronic Arts is also getting involved (WTH?!?!)
This just seems like it will be an epic fail. Who really wants to play video games on their Kindle?</description>

      <description>&amp;lt;p class=&amp;quot;wp-caption-text&amp;quot;&amp;gt; Image via Wikipedia &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; I was at Wally-World the other day getting a movie from RedBox with my wife when I noticed some guy enter in a code into the machine. The code was BREAKROOM. After watching him for a moment, I realized this code entitled him a free DVD rental.
Now, RedBox is pretty stinking cheap ($1.50/night), but if you‚Äôre an avid movie watcher, this really adds up.</description>

      <description>To some, this should seem a bit obvious and if I am insulting your intelligence by discussing it, I am sorry. But, one of the main reasons I want to discuss this topic is, I was asked this question in a job interview for Lockheed Martin.
What is the difference between i++ and ++i?
The answer is actually quite simple.
i++ first evaluates the value of i and then increments it ++i increments the value of i and then evaluates it Here is a brief example to demonstrate what I mean.</description>

I will kick it off today with a quick rant about the ternary operator. I &amp;lt;3 the ternary operator. It‚Äôs quick, efficient and saves a lot of ugly code.
For those of you who don‚Äôt know, the ternary operator is made up of 3 elements: The condition and two results.</description>

      <description>With the explosion of Twitter and such services, the need to have long URLs shortened has drastically increased. Naturally, many services to shorten URLs have sprung up as well.
Most of these services (that are worth using), have some sort of API that will allow developers to send a long URL to them, have it shortened and then returned. This type of service allows other developers to write applications that have the ability to shorten URLs right inside of them.</description>

      <description>The culture of Digg is generally very liberal (to say the least). That is why I was very surprised to find one of the top stories of the day entitled ‚ÄùWas Jesus A Real Person?‚Äù. Obviously, the comments section of the article was full of people arguing about the matter.
I found the article to be quite well written and made a stellar case for the existence of Jesus. So whether you are a believer or not, you should check it out.</description>

      <description>TweetPress is the WordPress plugin that gives you total control and ownership of the photos you post to Twitter, sending your traffic back to your own blog, instead of a third party site
I just finished development of this WordPress plugin and Andrew Stone of Twittelator has integrated it into his latest version of Twittelator Pro. As of this post, that version is still in review, so you will have to wait until it is approved to make use of TweetPress.</description>

      <description>If you are a serious blogger (and I‚Äôm sure you are), you probably track your RSS subscribers with FeedBurner. If you don‚Äôt, you should be. One thing that has always bugged me about FeedBurner is if you ever wanted to display the number of subscribers on your blog, you were stuck using their image. The image looks like this:
I‚Äôm sure you have seen this logo everywhere. Well, not too many people know it, but FeedBurner actually has a very simple API that allows you to just get the subscriber count so you can display it however you would like.</description>

      <description>If you are doing any Mac, iPhone, HTML5, etc‚Ä¶ developement, you have probably had the need for an sqlite database. So, you fire up your Terminal and start manully typing commands to do CREATEs and INSERTs.
You soon realize that this sucks and wish you had something like (shudders) PHPMyAdmin to manage your database. Well, now you do and it‚Äôs actually a lot less hiddeous than PHPMyAdmin.
Using the SQLite Manager plugin for Firefox, you can quickly CREATE, MODIFY, and DELETE sqlite databases visually.</description>

I know what you are saying‚Ä¶ Just switch to a more Rails friendly server. I like and know Apache. Not to mention I also host PHP apps.</description>

To take full advantage of the site, you must be the owner or have control over your own website. The idea is to create a tag that represents your website. A tag is a descriptive phrase or a creative tagline describing your site. Once you have added your tag, it gets added to the Tag Cloud.</description>

      <description>So, I started this site called iphonelb.com a few months back and left out a very important feature. The ability to edit your applications!?! What this means is, users have been testing their apps and putting in ‚Äútest data‚Äù and when it comes time for release, the can‚Äôt modify it.
Another feature missing, was the ability to clean out all of your test scores.
Well, thanks to about 8 minutes of my time, this has been resolved and the feature has been added.</description>

      <description>After seeing the show Parks and Recreation last night, I have come to the conclusion that the show is doomed to fail. Not only is it not funny, it‚Äôs jokes try to mimic the dry awkward humor of The Office. Parks and Recreation Fail!</description>

      <description>Twitter Trends are a very interesting part of Twitter. They are basically the most typed keywords or hashtags on twitter for a given day. Some examples might be #musicmonday or macHeist. These are fun and all but how can you use them to get traffic to my website/blog‚Ä¶
Find Trends That Refer To Articles People Are Linking To? Well, often times trends refer to words associated with website articles, videos, images, etc‚Ä¶ For example, the other day, the word mashable was trending on Twitter.</description>

      <description>What makes most multiplayer games more exciting that single player games? It‚Äôs competition! People love to compete with eachother.
And how can competition be achieved in single player games? Leaderboards.
A leaderboard is basically a table ranking players based on their scores in the game. This allows players to see how they stack up against other players.
The Problem
Many programmers either know how to do web development or system development.</description>

      <description>It‚Äôs been a while, but I finally posted part 3 of the iPhone Game Programming tutorial series on iCodeblog.com. The focus of this tutorial was to create a splash page for your game that fades into your game‚Äôs main view.
I chose to create this tutorial after seeing many games that just jump right in to the main game play. A splash page makes the game feel more ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù as well as gives the developer a chance to brand the app by displaying a company logo or something to that extent.</description>

Cheers!
So, I started writing a Twitter API Programming series last week‚Ä¶ Here is part 1. I have found that there is not much else to teach when it comes to interfacing with Twitter.</description>

      <description>I have been downloading many different iPhone apps lately and have noticed that many of them suck.
When I say they suck, I‚Äôm not necesarily referring to the content of the app. What I am talking about is the programming of the app. But Brandon, how do you know the programming sucks. Well, frequent crashing is an obvious indicator. Also, taking too long to do various computations as well as overall awkwardness.</description>

Buzzword is essentially a clone of the popular party game CatchPhrase ported on to the iPhone. Click Here for all the details on Buzzword.
I am asking a huge favor to anyone that wants to participate.</description>

      <description>I have recently started using Twitter and completely fell in love with it. Being a programming, this naturally made me want to develop applications for interfacing with it. So, I scoured the internet (checking Twitter‚Äôs website as well) to find good *simple tutorials for doing this. After searching for a while, I couldn‚Äôt really find any. Ok, I lied, I found a few but they were terrible. I hate tutorials that assume the reader knows more than they actually do.</description>

      <description>If you have ever had your own blog, you may have at one point been faced with a question. How often should I write a blog post and how long should each post be?
I have been thinking about this since I started blogging. It is a common thought that you must write a post every single day in order to increase/maintain traffic. But, is this really true? For busy people with families and lives (that aren‚Äôt blogging) might have a tough time writing a new content-rich post every single day.</description>

      <description>Well, it had taken me a while to slot in the time, but I finally finished part 2 of the iPhone Game Programming series iTennis on iCodeBlog.com . The game is shaping up to be pretty cool and I am really enjoying teaching about game programming.
I think that game programming is perfect for teaching people how to program a certain language. This is because games generally encompasses many aspects of programming (interface, logic, math, animation, AI, etc‚Ä¶).</description>

Here are some screenshots:
Once approved, Buzzword will only cost a buck. I‚Äôm not kidding, it will probably be the best dollar you have spent and will spend in your entire life.</description>

I will be writing tutorials based on the programming language that I am currently excited about. These will be anywhere from objective-c to ruby on rails to .NET. Whatever strikes my fancy.
Along the road, I will also be sharing my art (photo and drawing) as well as anything else I find interesting.
So just sit back and enjoy the magic of code!</description>
