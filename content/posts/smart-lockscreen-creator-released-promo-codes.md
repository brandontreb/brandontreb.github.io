My latest iOS app, Smart Lockscreen Creator has just released on iPhone for $.99.


[Download It Here](http://itunes.apple.com/app/smart-lockscreen-creator/id419890996?mt=8)


#### The Idea


Currently your lockscreen on your iOS device is nothing more than a pretty watch with a background. Jailbreakers have solved this issue with an incredible application called intelliscreen, which adds lots of interesting information to it. However, you and I are Apple fanboys and won‚Äôt violate our precious iPhones with jailbreaking. Enter Smart Lockscreen Creator.


Smart Lockscreen Creator allows you to build a completely custom (and smart) lockscreen image within the application. You then set this image as your lockscreen background. The following items are currently supported by the app.


* Current weather, condition, high and low for any city/region in the World
* Weekly forecast for any city/region in the World
* Monthly calendar
* Custom text
* Blank space (useful when customizing the look of your lockscreen)
* Line separator
* Many more in the works!


Here are some promo codes. If you fail to grab one and have some interest in reviewing the app on your site, I would be happy to email you one.
