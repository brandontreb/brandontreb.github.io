*Hot take*: [The Super Mario Bros Movie, 2023](https://www.thesupermariobros.movie/) movie was just *fine*. ★★½


I actually agree with [Roger Ebert](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-super-mario-bros-movie-movie-review-2023) on this one:



> 
> The latest animated blockbuster from Illumination is their most soulless to date, a film that feels like ChatGPT produced it after data and imagery from the games were fed into a computer.
> 
>

I really wanted it to be like [Wreck it Ralf](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt1772341/). A nostalgic movie I adore.
