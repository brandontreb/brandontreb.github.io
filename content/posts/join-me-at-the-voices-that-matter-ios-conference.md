In November, I will be attending the [Voices That Matter iOS Developers conference][1]. It will be my third time attending, and I can&#8217;t recommend it enough. One major change from this year however is, I will be attending as a sponsor. A new company/project (currently in private alpha) will be participating as a sponsor at the conference.

We intend to have a table set up with multiple computers and devices so you can check out our product first hand. Bleh, that sounds kind of spammy. But, we have been working on something incredibly killer and I can&#8217;t wait to share it with all of you.

**If YOU are planning on attending the conference**, please comment on this post, [write me on Twitter][2], or email me. I&#8217;d love to set up a one on one time to give you the full demo.

Also, I&#8217;m sure many of you already have a discount code, but if not, I have a pretty sweet promo code for $100!

#### BSTBLOG

Enter that at checkout. Combining that with the &#8220;Early Bird Pricing&#8221;, you save $300! Not a bad deal.

So, if you do end up coming (you are crazy not to), please communicate with me. At least to say hi, you don&#8217;t *have* to here my super awesome sales spiel if you don&#8217;t want to&#8230;

Happy Coding!
