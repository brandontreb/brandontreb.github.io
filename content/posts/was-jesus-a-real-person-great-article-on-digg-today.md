The culture of Digg is generally very liberal (to say the least). That is why I was very surprised to find one of the top stories of the day entitled ”[Was Jesus A Real Person?](http://digg.com/people/Was_Jesus_a_real_person)”. Obviously, the comments section of the article was full of people arguing about the matter.


I found the article to be quite well written and made a stellar case for the existence of Jesus. So whether you are a believer or not, you should check it out. [Take a look for yourself](http://www.y-jesus.com/bornid_1.php?gclid=CMfD2puS_Z0CFRUwpAodl1mgrw) and let me know what you think.
