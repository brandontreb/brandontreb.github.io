The publishing that I’m writing the book for is having a huge Friday the 13th sale. They are offering a $13 discount on all of their books. For those of you who don’t know, Manning publishes all of the “In Action” books.


All you have to do is [go to the site](http://manning.com) and enter the coupon code:


## fri13


when checking out and you will get the discount. Although my book iPhone In Action 2nd Edition hasn’t been released yet, Manning has some other killer programming books for sale.


So be sure to [check it out](http://manning.com)!
