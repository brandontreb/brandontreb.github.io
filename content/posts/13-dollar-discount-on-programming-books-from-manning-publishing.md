The publishing that I&#8217;m writing the book for is having a huge Friday the 13th sale. They are offering a $13 discount on all of their books. For those of you who don&#8217;t know, Manning publishes all of the &#8220;In Action&#8221; books.

All you have to do is [go to the site][1] and enter the coupon code:

## fri13

when checking out and you will get the discount. Although my book iPhone In Action 2nd Edition hasn&#8217;t been released yet, Manning has some other killer programming books for sale.

So be sure to [check it out][1]!
