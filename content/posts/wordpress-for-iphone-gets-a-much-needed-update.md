A few days ago, the popular blogging tool [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) released a much needed update to their iPhone application. The main features included in the update were:


* Landscape mode for writing posts – This is a huge one. It was a total pain in the butt writing blog posts with the vertical keyboard
* Page Editing/Creation – Meh… How often do you do this?
* Comment Moderation – Very excited about this feature. I love being able to check out comments quickly without loading my entire blog.
* Photo resizing – Very cool option. Makes photo uploads go much quicker.


If you have both an iPhone AND a WordPress blog (your own host or [WordPress.com](http://WordPress.com)), I would highly suggest [downloading](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=285073074&mt=8) the WordPress iPhone app for blogging on the go.


Hopefully, having the landscape keyboard mode will motivate me to blog more often.
