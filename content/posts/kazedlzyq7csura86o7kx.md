Whenever I meet new people, I’m terrible with remembering their names. It would seem that the moment they tell me their name, I instantly forget it.


Lately, I have started writing down people’s names in my notes along with something I remember about them (I know, I’m Michael Scott). I will also put them under headings that refer to the context in which I met them.


An example of this might be


**Soccer**


* Mike: Lawyer, wears a suit everywhere
* David: twins on the soccer team
* Steven: bald with beard


**Gym**


* Christian: Manbun


This has been working surprisingly well, as the moment I write a name down with a character trait, I remember it forever. Very seldom have I had to go back and review my notes.


It does make me wonder though, what memorable character trait does someone have written down in their notes about me?
