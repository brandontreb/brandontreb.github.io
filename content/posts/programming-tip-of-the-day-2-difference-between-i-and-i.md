To some, this should seem a bit obvious and if I am insulting your intelligence by discussing it, I am sorry. But, one of the main reasons I want to discuss this topic is, I was asked this question in a job interview for Lockheed Martin.


**What is the difference between i++ and ++i?**


The answer is actually quite simple.


### i++ first evaluates the value of i and then increments it


### ++i increments the value of i and then evaluates it


Here is a brief example to demonstrate what I mean.

```
// Example: i++ 
$i = 5;
echo "The value of i is " . $i++ ;
// Output "The value of i is 5"
// i = 6
Â 
// Example: ++i 
$i = 5;
echo "The value of i is " . ++$i;
// Output "The value of i is 6"
// i = 6
```

So, now if you are ever asked about this in an interview, you will have a response.


Happy programming!
