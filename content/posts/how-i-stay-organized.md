My wife and I are hard core “type-a” people. I mean, so planned that we send each other calendar invites for date night (don’t judge what we consider romantic ;)). 

I didn’t used to be like this. When I was younger and in college, I was a total scatter brain, a C student by choice. 

This all changed the day I was laid off and had to start my own company. Owning a business requires me to pay attention to every detail, every invoice, dev rate, hours budget,etc... Its exhausting and college Brandon would have been out years ago. 

Fortunately (and I can already feel this sounding like a sales pitch), I use [Bullet Journal](https://bulletjournal.com/). It’s basically a system using only a notebook and pen to organize your life. Think 90’s style leather day planner. 

While I don’t use every “module” that it offers, I use the system to manage todos, notes, long and short term goals, and lists (this blog post title just came from one such list). 

So, if you are like I was, I highly recommend bullet journaling. It will change your life for the better (worse?).
