As developers, we spend so much time perfecting our craft. We are always on the hunt for hacks, tips, and tweaks. 

We always set out to write the most clever and reusable code possible. This is all great...until it’s time to ship. 

I have seen it time after time. Developers over-optimizing their code, writing protocol after protocol. All the while, they slip further and further behind schedule. 

When the client asks the dev about the delay on feature X, the dev proceeds to explain the super cool reusable, component-driven,state managed, highly available, future proof, buzzword, buzzword system they are creating. The client literally doesn’t care about all that. They just wants to see feature X working. 

I love clever code as much as the next developer, but sometimes you’ve got to table your inner CS geek and just ship something that works. Then, refactor later.
