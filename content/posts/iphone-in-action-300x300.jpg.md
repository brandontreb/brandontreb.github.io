  A couple months ago, I was asked by someone on Twitter if they could &#8220;introduce me to someone&#8221;. I found this question a little odd so I responded with &#8220;like a girl or a developer?&#8221;. I often tweet about my wife, so I was hoping he was not referring to a girl. He replied with &#8220;no, someone at Manning Publishing, they are looking for an author for their book iPhone In Action&#8221;. So, I was put in contact with Manning and they eventually offered me the position as one of the authors on the book iPhone In Action.

  iPhone In Action is a book (that is already out) and details how to program for the webkit as well as the native iPhone OS. I will be removing the webkit chapters, updating some of the dated chapters, and writing about 6 new chapters related to OS 3.0.

  I will be posting about the book and my progress along the way (don&#8217;t worry I won&#8217;t stop my random tutorials about Twitter, WordPress, etc&#8230;). Just wanted to share that and say go out and buy the book (in December when I am finished and will get the commission <img src="http://brandontreb.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> ).

  Happy Coding!
