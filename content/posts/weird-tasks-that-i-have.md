Many of you might not know this, but my family and I live in a [converted schoolbus](http://trebventure.com).


Today, I had quite a few “bus chores” and I figured that I would share them here because together, they do seem a bit odd.


* Change composting toilet
* Fill up propane tanks
* Add heat tape to fresh water lines
* Replace RV vent in roof because it started leaking


Sometimes I wonder if I have *more* chores on the bus than in a traditional home.


Whatever, off to chop wood for my [tiny wood stove](http://www.instagram.com/trebventure/p/Bj47D7hn2U9/)…
