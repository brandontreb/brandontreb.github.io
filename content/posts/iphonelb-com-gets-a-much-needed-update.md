So, I started this site called [iphonelb.com](http://iphonelb.com) a few months back and left out a very important feature. The ability to edit your applications!?! What this means is, users have been testing their apps and putting in “test data” and when it comes time for release, the can’t modify it.


Another feature missing, was the ability to clean out all of your test scores.


Well, thanks to about 8 minutes of my time, this has been resolved and the feature has been added. I am really excited about iphonelb and have some big things planned for it in the future. [Write me on Twitter](http://twitter.com/brandontreb) or on my blog if you have any feature requests for it.
