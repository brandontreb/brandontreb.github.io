As you may have noticed, my blog has a new (much cleaner) theme. For 2012, my blogging goals are to focus much more on content rather than flashy visuals.

I have also minimized my set up to save blogging costs (I now blog for FREE) and to simplify things greatly. Here is my new setup:

  * [Jekyll][1] as my &#8220;blog engine&#8221;
  * [The WPTypo WordPress Theme][2] I ported this to Jekyll
  * [GitHub][3] for hosting (it&#8217;s free).
  * Vim &#8211; I&#8217;m using this as my &#8220;blog editor&#8221;. There are some incredible plugins that I am using to help facilitate blogging using Jekyll (post on how I do this to follow)

That&#8217;s about it. I am now free from server costs and my blog is **always** backed up and easily accessible.

2011 has been a very successful year in terms of blogging for me. In addition to writing here and on [iCodeBlog][4], I have recently started blogging for Mobile Tuts + on the [Envato Network][5]. You can check out my 7 part game series on creating a caterpillar game using Cocos2D [here][6].

I can&#8217;t wait to start posting some great content in this new year. Given my new setup, I literally have to adhere to the title of this post as blogging in VIM doesn&#8217;t really lend itself to visuals ;).

Happy New Year and Happy Hacking in 2012!
