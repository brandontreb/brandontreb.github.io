As you may have noticed, my blog has a new (much cleaner) theme. For 2012, my blogging goals are to focus much more on content rather than flashy visuals.


I have also minimized my set up to save blogging costs (I now blog for FREE) and to simplify things greatly. Here is my new setup:


* [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) as my “blog engine”
* [The WPTypo WordPress Theme](http://www.wptux.com/206/wp-typo) I ported this to Jekyll
* [GitHub](https://github.com/brandontreb/brandontreb.github.com) for hosting (it’s free).
* Vim – I’m using this as my “blog editor”. There are some incredible plugins that I am using to help facilitate blogging using Jekyll (post on how I do this to follow)


That’s about it. I am now free from server costs and my blog is **always** backed up and easily accessible.


2011 has been a very successful year in terms of blogging for me. In addition to writing here and on [iCodeBlog](http://icodeblog.com), I have recently started blogging for Mobile Tuts + on the [Envato Network](http://envato.com). You can check out my 7 part game series on creating a caterpillar game using Cocos2D [here](http://mobile.tutsplus.com/series/build-a-caterpillar-game-with-cocos2d/).


I can’t wait to start posting some great content in this new year. Given my new setup, I literally have to adhere to the title of this post as blogging in VIM doesn’t really lend itself to visuals ;).


Happy New Year and Happy Hacking in 2012!
