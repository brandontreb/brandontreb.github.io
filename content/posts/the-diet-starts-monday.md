In our house, we often joke that “the diet starts Monday”. Usually, this is in response to some conclusion that we are not currently on the healthiest path. 

Procrastination is in our DNA. We put everything off until the absolute last minute. For me, it’s usually side projects. Projects that I know will make some revenue to supplement some of my consulting income. It’s my goal to eventually move on from consulting, however that has been on my “resolution list” for years, with little progress. 

I’m committed to finishing one such project before the years up. I should get hacking on it...on Monday.
