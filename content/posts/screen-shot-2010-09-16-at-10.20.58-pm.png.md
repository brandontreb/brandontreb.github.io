Ok, so maybe this is stupid, reposting your own content in multiple areas. As far as SEO goes, it may not be the best idea. However, I really love Tumblr and I really love WordPress. I can&#8217;t seem to part with either yet I don&#8217;t quite have the time for both.

I put out a quick tweet earlier today (and this is why I flippin love Twitter), asking if anyone knew of a good way to connect WordPress to Twitter. Here are the popular options.

  1. Use Tumblr&#8217;s feed importer (suggested by [@abrahamvegh][1]). This option requires you to enter your blog&#8217;s RSS feed. Tumblr then scans your RSS feed every so often and pulls the new posts. I didn&#8217;t care too much for this approach because it&#8217;s not instantaneous. I added my feed and it told me that it would refresh in about an hour. After an hour it still didn&#8217;t pull my WordPress posts and had a status of queued.  
    [<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-919" title="Screen shot 2010-09-16 at 10.20.58 PM" src="/uploads/2010/Screen-shot-2010-09-16-at-10.20.58-PM.png" alt="" width="313" height="253" />][2]
  2. [][2] There are quite a few Tumblr WordPress plugins out there. I have tried a few and have seen no success. Until one of my twitter followers (**[@TheSilber][3]) **suggested that I use [tumblrize][4]. Tumblrize is a great plugin that worked perfectly right out of the box. It was easy to set up and boasts quite a few options.&#8221;Tumblrize posts to Tumblr whenever you hit the &#8220;publish&#8221; button. It uses Tumblr&#8217;s simple API to keep posts in sync; when you edit your WordPress post, it updates your Tumblr post.&#8221;  
    <img class="alignnone" title="Tumblrize" src="http://id.ijulien.com/img/tumblrize.png" alt="" width="290" height="49" />

I would highly recommend option 2 if you are planning on syncing your WordPress blog with your Tumblr.
