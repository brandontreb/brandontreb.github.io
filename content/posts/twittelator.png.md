> TweetPress is the WordPress plugin that gives you total control and ownership of the photos you post to Twitter, sending your traffic back to your own blog, instead of a third party site

I just finished development of this WordPress plugin and Andrew Stone of Twittelator has integrated it into his latest version of [Twittelator Pro][1]. As of this post, that version is still in review, so you will have to wait until it is approved to make use of TweetPress.

I have some other very big plans for future releases of TweetPress and if you have any feature requests, feel free to drop me a line. I will do a post as soon as the latest version of Twittelator is approved and demo how it integrates with TweetPress.
