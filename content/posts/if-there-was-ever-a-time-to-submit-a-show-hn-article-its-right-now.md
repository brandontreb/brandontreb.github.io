Earlier today a post titled &#8221;<a href="http://tortillasinbed.tumblr.com/post/24175048206/i-up-vote-everything" title="" target="">I Try to Up Vote Every ‘Show HN’ Post and You Should Too</a>&#8221; made it to the top of HN. &nbsp;It basically talked about people posting &#8220;Show HN&#8221; posts are putting themselves out there and the least we can do is give them an up vote. &nbsp;Well, people are listening and as of this posting, there are currently 15 Show HN posts in the top 30. &nbsp;That&#8217;s incredible.

  So, if you have recently created something cool. &nbsp;Head over to HN&#8217;s <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/submit" title="" target="">submission page</a> and add your link making sure to add &#8220;Show HN&#8221; in the title. &nbsp;You might get some great traffic/feedback out of it.
