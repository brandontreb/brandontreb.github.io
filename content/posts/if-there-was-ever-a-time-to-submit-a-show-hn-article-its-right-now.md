Earlier today a post titled ”[I Try to Up Vote Every ‘Show HN’ Post and You Should Too](http://tortillasinbed.tumblr.com/post/24175048206/i-up-vote-everything)” made it to the top of HN.  It basically talked about people posting “Show HN” posts are putting themselves out there and the least we can do is give them an up vote.  Well, people are listening and as of this posting, there are currently 15 Show HN posts in the top 30.  That’s incredible.





 So, if you have recently created something cool.  Head over to HN’s [submission page](http://news.ycombinator.com/submit) and add your link making sure to add “Show HN” in the title.  You might get some great traffic/feedback out of it.
