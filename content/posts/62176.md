I just saw a message today that Github is going to start charging for Co Pilot.
While this bums me out, it definitely saves me more than $10/month in time.  

Cp Pilot has become an integral part of my workflow and saves me hours of Stack Overflow research as well as time spent copying and pasting of boilerplate code.
