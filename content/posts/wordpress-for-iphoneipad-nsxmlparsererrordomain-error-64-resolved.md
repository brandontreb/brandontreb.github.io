If you have a WordPress blog and an iPhone/iPad, then you most likely have the [WordPress for iOS][1] app. If you don&#8217;t, you [should][1].

Over the past couple of days, I have been receiving the following error when trying to add my blog to the iPhone app.

[<img class="size-medium wp-image-859 alignnone" title="photo" src="http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/photo-333x500.png" alt="" width="333" height="500" />][2]

After scouring the internet, I found that this could be the result of a few issues.

  * Special characters in a post body that are not supported by NSXMLParser
  * Special characters in a comment
  * Invalid post or comment RSS
  * An error in a theme/plugin file

For me, this turned out to be an issue with the comments RSS feed. I loaded it up in the browser and long behold, even the browser threw an error. But what could be causing this? Turns out, I had left a space in a plugin that I created. This caused a space to be output at the beginning of the comments XML, causing it to error. Notice the space between ?> and <?php below. (Face Palm)

After removing the space from this plugin, I loaded up WordPress for iPhone and it added my blog without a problem.

So, the take away from this is **don&#8217;t output spaces when you create a plugin.**

I hope this post has proven useful for you, I can&#8217;t imagine that I&#8217;m the only person with this issue 😉
