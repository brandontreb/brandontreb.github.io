If you have a WordPress blog and an iPhone/iPad, then you most likely have the [WordPress for iOS](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wordpress/id335703880?mt=8) app. If you donâ€™t, you [should](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wordpress/id335703880?mt=8).


Over the past couple of days, I have been receiving the following error when trying to add my blog to the iPhone app.


[![](/uploads/2010/photo-333x500.png "photo")](http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/photo.png)


After scouring the internet, I found that this could be the result of a few issues.


* Special characters in a post body that are not supported by NSXMLParser
* Special characters in a comment
* Invalid post or comment RSS
* An error in a theme/plugin file


For me, this turned out to be an issue with the comments RSS feed. I loaded it up in the browser and long behold, even the browser threw an error. But what could be causing this? Turns out, I had left a space in a plugin that I created. This caused a space to be output at the beginning of the comments XML, causing it to error. Notice the space between ?> and <?php below. (Face Palm)

After removing the space from this plugin, I loaded up WordPress for iPhone and it added my blog without a problem.


So, the take away from this is **donâ€™t output spaces when you create a plugin.**


I hope this post has proven useful for you, I canâ€™t imagine that Iâ€™m the only person with this issue ğŸ˜‰
