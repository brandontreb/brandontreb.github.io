I have really been enjoying listening to [Darknet Diaries](https://darknetdiaries.com/) lately. Itâ€™s a Podcast about hacks and software security vulnerabilities. 

The show really makes me realize how crappy and insecure most software is. Most importantly, it has gotten me much more security-minded in the software that I build. 

If you arenâ€™t already listening to it, Iâ€™d suggest you [check it out](https://darknetdiaries.com/). You will soon put on your tin foil hat like me and start to believe everybody is trying to hack you.
