Over the past few months, I have had the pleasure of working on a [DApp called thisorthat.io](http://thisorthat.io) built on the Ethereum network.  It has been an absolute blast.  I have had so much fun building the smart contracts as well as the React front-end interface.  

I truly believe there is a huge future here, and it can be especially lucrative for developers/startup teams.  If you look at [Dapp Radar](https://dappradar.com/), you can see that many of the top DApps have less than 1,000 DAU (daily active users).  If you consider how much money is being made, crypto-users end up being **much more** valuable than users on any other platform. 

Take for example, [Crypto Kitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/). It&#39;s basically a mix of Beanie Babies and Tamagatchis. According to DApp Radar, 380 ETH (or $255K USD) has moved through their platform in the past 7 days **with only 652 daily active users!!!**. This is absolutely insane.

It&#39;s not all sunshine and rainbows though.  After spending 80+ hours working on a crypto-centric app, I believe I have some insight into some pain points that will need to be solved before these types of apps are to be widely adopted. 

In my next post, I will discuss some of the hurdles preventing DApps from going mainstream.  There is so much room for improvement and innovation in this space, I feel that all devs should be looking at crypto like we looked at mobile dev in 2008.

To the moon!
