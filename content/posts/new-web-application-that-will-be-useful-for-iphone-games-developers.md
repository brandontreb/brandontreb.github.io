So, after downloading many iPhone games and talking with a ton of iphone developers, I have a found a huge need in the community. Over the next week I will be developing a killer web application with a web service API that will be free to iPhone developers to use.


I am not going to give out any details at the moment, but be sure to subscribe to my RSS feed as I will be blogging about it through out next week (Spring Break = Time to develop). It should be completed by late next week.


I guarantee, if you are an iPhone game developer, you will benefit tremendously from what I am about to release.


Excited? So am Iâ€¦
