I mentioned this on Twitter last week, so I might as well post it here to make it *more* official. My talk **Making Your Games More Dynamic With Lua Scripting** was accepted for [360iDev 2012][1]! This will be my first official speaking engagement and I could not be more excited/nervous.

#### The Talk

I have had a huge interest in lua for some time now, especially as it applies to scripting games. In my last project, [Pocket MUD Pro][2], I even embedded lua 5.1 and created my own bridge in order to allow players to fully script the gameplay. This got me very excited for the future as it was so easy to get lua up and running.

My talk will cover the basics of setting lua up in your own iOS projects. I will be using a simple tile based RPG (written in Cocos2D) for the demo and will demonstrate how you might use lua to script the behaviors of the NPCs as well as dynamically add new ones to the game. This opens up a whole world of possibility as you can now ship code over the wire and modify your game content without ever submitting an update to Apple.

It appears my talk has some pretty steep competition in its timeslot. There are two other incredible talks going on at the same time, so I&#8217;m starting to campaign for it now <img src="http://brandontreb.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Please comment on this post if you plan on attending 360iDev. I would love to connect with you.
