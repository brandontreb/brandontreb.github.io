The purpose of this blog will be primarily to share my programming knowledge through coding tutorials.


I will be writing tutorials based on the programming language that I am currently excited about. These will be anywhere from objective-c to ruby on rails to .NET. Whatever strikes my fancy.


Along the road, I will also be sharing my art (photo and drawing) as well as anything else I find interesting.


So just sit back and enjoy the magic of code!
