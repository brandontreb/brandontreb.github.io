So, I started this site called [iphonelb.com][1] a few months back and left out a very important feature. The ability to edit your applications!?! What this means is, users have been testing their apps and putting in &#8220;test data&#8221; and when it comes time for release, the can&#8217;t modify it.

Another feature missing, was the ability to clean out all of your test scores.

Well, thanks to about 8 minutes of my time, this has been resolved and the feature has been added. I am really excited about iphonelb and have some big things planned for it in the future. [Write me on Twitter][2] or on my blog if you have any feature requests for it.
