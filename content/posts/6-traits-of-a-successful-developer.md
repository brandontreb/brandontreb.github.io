In my experience, developers tend to become arrogant and totally ignore #1 (see Windows Devs). I feel that this is the most important trait of all.

The field is too large, too quickly changing, and too in depth for any developer to ever “know it all.” Luckily there are a lot of resources a developer can use to learn; books, co-workers, classes, [blogs](http://www.turnleafdesign.com/), among many others.”
