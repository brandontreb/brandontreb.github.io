Tonight, I accidentally signed up for Hot Yoga **sculpt** instead of the regular hot yoga. It was literally one of the most intense hours of my life. Apple Watch puts my heart rate in zone 5 for more than 50% of the workout (that’s like 170bpm).


By the time I got out, my head was spinning like I had just smoked 2 cigars and drank a few whiskeys.


So…I’m pretty sure I’m going again next week (on purpose this time).
