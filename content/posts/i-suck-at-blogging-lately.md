OK, so the title isn&#8217;t entirely true (I have maintained quite a few blogs in my day). But, one thing is for sure, I have sucked at blogging **lately**. So much so, I just had to think hard about having to bold lately using markdown in the previous sentence *#meta*.

#### Burnout

I was blogging very consistently for the [Envato Network][1] on their [Mobile Tuts Plus][2] as well as on [iCodeBlog][3] and here. Eventually, I got burnt out and gave up blogging on every blog (for the month).

What happened was, I was blogging to make money (Envato pays $250/post!) and no longer for fun. This sucks and I was missing deadlines and writing crappy content which needed much revision.

#### New Plan

Write here only (for fun!) and infrequently on icode if time permits as I can do that during work time ðŸ˜‰ That being said, expect to see more content here for better or worse. Once a week is the new goal.

#### Shutup

That&#8217;s what you are saying to me. I hate these &#8220;Sorry I haven&#8217;t been around in a while. I promise to post more&#8221; posts that are usually the last posts on a blog for like 5 years just as much as you do. Let&#8217;s hope that&#8217;s not the case here. You will just have to trust me and [subscribe][4].

Also, I have a sweet new theme from [Jekyll Bootstrap][5].
