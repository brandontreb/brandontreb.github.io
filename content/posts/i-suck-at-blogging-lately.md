OK, so the title isn‚Äôt entirely true (I have maintained quite a few blogs in my day). But, one thing is for sure, I have sucked at blogging **lately**. So much so, I just had to think hard about having to bold lately using markdown in the previous sentence *#meta*.


#### Burnout


I was blogging very consistently for the [Envato Network](http://envato.com) on their [Mobile Tuts Plus](http://mobile.tutsplus.com) as well as on [iCodeBlog](http://icodeblog.com) and here. Eventually, I got burnt out and gave up blogging on every blog (for the month).


What happened was, I was blogging to make money (Envato pays $250/post!) and no longer for fun. This sucks and I was missing deadlines and writing crappy content which needed much revision.


#### New Plan


Write here only (for fun!) and infrequently on icode if time permits as I can do that during work time üòâ That being said, expect to see more content here for better or worse. Once a week is the new goal.


#### Shutup


That‚Äôs what you are saying to me. I hate these ‚ÄúSorry I haven‚Äôt been around in a while. I promise to post more‚Äù posts that are usually the last posts on a blog for like 5 years just as much as you do. Let‚Äôs hope that‚Äôs not the case here. You will just have to trust me and [subscribe](http://feeds.feedburner.com/brandontreb).


Also, I have a sweet new theme from [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/).
