 If you have a blog/website then you probably have heard of [Alexa](http://alexa.com). If not, you should search your blog in it to find out some interesting stats. Being a stat junkie, I check services like this frequently.




 It appears that Alexa has recently updated their interface from their old jenk **web .05** hideousness. While itâ€™s not quite **web 2.0**, Iâ€™d say it has a good start as web 1.6 (maybe 1.7 because of the shine on the logo).




 On a side note, icodeblog seems to be huge in Canada ðŸ˜‰
