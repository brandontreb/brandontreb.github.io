A few days ago, the popular blogging tool [WordPress][2] released a much needed update to their iPhone application. The main features included in the update were:

  * Landscape mode for writing posts &#8211; This is a huge one. It was a total pain in the butt writing blog posts with the vertical keyboard
  * Page Editing/Creation &#8211; Meh&#8230; How often do you do this?
  * Comment Moderation &#8211; Very excited about this feature. I love being able to check out comments quickly without loading my entire blog.
  * Photo resizing &#8211; Very cool option. Makes photo uploads go much quicker.

If you have both an iPhone AND a WordPress blog (your own host or WordPress.com), I would highly suggest [downloading][3] the WordPress iPhone app for blogging on the go.

Hopefully, having the landscape keyboard mode will motivate me to blog more often.
