![Inverted Aeropress](/uploads/2023/photo-1652067871073-d472c02125b6?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1287&q=80)


Over the years, I have tried many Aeropress methods for making coffee. After many variations, I have found this one to be the best and most consistent.


### Recipe


* Method: [inverted](https://aeropress.com/blogs/aeropress-recipes/the-aeropress-inverted-method-the-official-aeropress-inverted-guide)
* Beans: 30g (usually Ethiopian)
* Grind: course
* Water: 200g
* Time: 60s


### Instructions


Start heating the water in a kettle. While the water is heating, grind **30g** of coffee in the grinder and pour it into the inverted Aeropress.


Place the Aeropress on the scale, pour in **100g** of water, and stir. Once stirred, set a timer for **60s**. Take this time to place the paper filter inside the Aeropress’ lid and rinse the paper. It ensures that it sticks better and removes some of the paper taste.


After the timer is up, stir one more time, attach the filter, and plunge into your cup.


Finally, pour another **100g** of water into the cup and enjoy one of the best cups of coffee of your life.


Let me know if you end up trying it!
