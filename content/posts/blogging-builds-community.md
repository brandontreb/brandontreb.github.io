It's been around 3 weeks since I started [blogging every weekday](http://www.brandontreb.com/on-blogging-more-frequently.html). This experience has been nothing short of delightful.


While I have seen many improvements in my communication (written and verbal), I believe the best benefit is around the community.


When I started blogging in 2008, my posts used to have upwards of 100 comments. Granted I was a renegade blogging about iOS in a time of Apple's dreaded NDA. I absolutely **loved** the feedback and the community that was forming around my writing. I have been blogging on and off since then and have never felt that same spark.


This all changed, when I made a commitment to writing daily short-form blog posts and posting them to [micro.blog](https://micro.blog/brandontreb) and [twitter](https://twitter.com/brandontreb). I began to receive comments, and these comments turned into *real* discussions.


This has been a blast as I'm now able to connect with so many wonderful people in the community. We are sharing thoughts and ideas and challenging each other’s beliefs on tech, business, etc…


So, I challenge you. If you are on the fence, just stop worrying about the quality/frequency/etc… of your writing and just write. And once you have written, share it with others. I promise you, the community you will build is worth it!
