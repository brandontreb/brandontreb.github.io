From the first time I saw this effect in the Tweetie (now [Twitter for iPhone](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/twitter/id333903271?mt=8)), I was crazy about it. I had written my own hacks to make something *close*, but it was always terrible. Within the past few months, I have been using a perfect/elegant solution to this problem called [SVProgressHUD](https://github.com/samvermette/SVProgressHUD).

Using this in your project is as easy as calling:





```
// showing
[SVProgressHUD showWithStatus:@"Logging inâ€¦"];
// hiding
[SVProgressHUD dismiss];
```
