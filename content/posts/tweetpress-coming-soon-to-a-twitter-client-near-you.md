I just finished development of this WordPress plugin and Andrew Stone of Twittelator has integrated it into his latest version of [Twittelator Pro](http://stone.com/Twittelator/index.html). As of this post, that version is still in review, so you will have to wait until it is approved to make use of TweetPress.


I have some other very big plans for future releases of TweetPress and if you have any feature requests, feel free to drop me a line. I will do a post as soon as the latest version of Twittelator is approved and demo how it integrates with TweetPress.
