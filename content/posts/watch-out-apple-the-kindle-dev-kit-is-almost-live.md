With the success of the [Apple App Store](http://www.apple.com/iphone/appstore/ "App Store"), it seems that everyone is wanting a piece of the pie.


Amazon is now looking to throw their hat into the ring and is releasing their own dev kit for their ever so popular Kindle.

It appears that big name game developers Electronic Arts is also getting involved (WTH?!?!)


This just seems like it will be an epic fail. Who really wants to play video games on their Kindle? Maybe they can port [Kirbyâ€™s Dreamland](http://brandontreb.com/code-monkey-music-video/) from the original Game Boy ![:)](/uploads/2010/simple-smile.png) .
