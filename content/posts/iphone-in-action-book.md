 A couple months ago, I was asked by someone on Twitter if they could “introduce me to someone”. I found this question a little odd so I responded with “like a girl or a developer?”. I often tweet about my wife, so I was hoping he was not referring to a girl. He replied with “no, someone at Manning Publishing, they are looking for an author for their book iPhone In Action”. So, I was put in contact with Manning and they eventually offered me the position as one of the authors on the book iPhone In Action.




 iPhone In Action is a book (that is already out) and details how to program for the webkit as well as the native iPhone OS. I will be removing the webkit chapters, updating some of the dated chapters, and writing about 6 new chapters related to OS 3.0.




 I will be posting about the book and my progress along the way (don’t worry I won’t stop my random tutorials about Twitter, WordPress, etc…). Just wanted to share that and say go out and buy the book (in December when I am finished and will get the commission ![:)](/uploads/2009/simple-smile.png) ).




 Happy Coding!
