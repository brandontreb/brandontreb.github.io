I have just released another WordPress plugin called Feedburner Anywhere.


What it does is allow you to display your RSS subscriber count anywhere on your blog.


You have the choice of using the built-in widget, embedding it in your posts/pages, or a combination of both.


Check out my sidebar for an example of usage.


[Download Feedburner Anywhere at WordPress.org](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/feedburner-anywhere/)
