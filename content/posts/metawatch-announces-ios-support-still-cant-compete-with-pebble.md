<img class="alignleft" title="Metawatch" src="http://www.metawatch.org/assets/components/phpthumbof/cache/b1ef2f2c734bdb5c3dd128645e931609.5b076a068df3c2e957af266fa3005e90.jpg" alt="" width="217" height="325" />For those of you who have followed my blog for a while, you know that I am a huge geek for smart watches. I had the first version of what is now the <a title="" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/597507018/pebble-e-paper-watch-for-iphone-and-android" target="_blank">Pebble</a> (<a title="" href="http://getinpulse.com" target="_blank">inPulse</a>) and even hacked a jailbroken iOS app to interface with it.

<a title="" href="http://metawatch.com" target="_blank">MetaWatch</a> has been around for quite some time now and looks *ok *, however their latest update appears to be completely in response to Allerta&#8217;s announcement/success of Pebble.

> &#8220;We are delighted to be the first company to ship a Bluetooth 4.0 smartwatch compatible with both iPhone and Android platforms&#8221;

What is really concerning is the fact they they don&#8217;t mention anything related to how they are achieving iOS notifications. Pebble has been very upfront in stating that they are planning on leveraging <a title="" href="http://ifttt.com/" target="_blank">ifttt.com</a> to deliver complex notifications such as Twitter and Facebook. It leads me to believe they haven&#8217;t quite sorted everything out and are jumping to a press release in order to ride the smartwatch train.

  I have a <a title="" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/597507018/pebble-e-paper-watch-for-iphone-and-android" target="">Pebble</a> coming in August and intend on sharing my experiences as well as code. Perhaps I might scoop up one of these as well and write a comparison post.
