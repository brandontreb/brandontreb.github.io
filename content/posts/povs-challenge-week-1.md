After a week of studying my butt off with OpenGL ES, I have finally started work on my game engine for my [Pov’s Challenge](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2010/09/22/povs-challenge-make-a-game-sell-1-copy/) game.


As you can tell from the screenshot below, I have been playing entirely too much Minecraft and have cube art on the brain.


It’s not much right now, but I do have a basic cube rendering engine that takes in a level file and renders the environment. Here is a screenshot of a very simple level.

**Ohh My Game Idea You Ask?**


Well, without going into too much detail, it’s pretty much an epic battle of mass proportion set in a 3D cube environment (hint: it’s not iMinecraft ;)).


I will give more details as I go about the month and near the completion of my game.


Also, in case you are interested, here is what the level file looks like for the generated environment.



```
**GG,GG,GG,G,GG,GG,GG
GG,G,G,G,G,G,GG
GG,G,G,G,G,G,GG
GG,G,G,G,G,G,GG
G,G,G,GG,G,G,G
GG,G,G,G,G,G,GG
GG,G,G,G,G,G,GG
GG,G,G,G,G,G,GG
GG,GG,GG,G,GG,GG,GG**
```

The number of G’s that appear represent the height at that location.


**The current roadmap is:**


* Texturing & Lighting
* Collision Detection / Navigation
* Gameplay & Audio
* AI
* Menus / Title / Pause ([secret sauce ingredients](http://www.36peas.com/blog/2010/10/6/just-add-the-secret-sauce-a-tried-and-tested-recipe-for-a-fi.html))


By next week, I should have some sort of level editor and some basic skinning going on.


Hopefully I can finish this sucker by the end of the month. Its’s been an intense journey learning openGL from scratch in 7 days and I know that I still have quite a ways to go. Again, if you are participating in this challenge, link me to your development blog in the comments.


Happy coding!
