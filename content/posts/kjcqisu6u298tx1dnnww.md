My daughter just got a toy today that resembles a [Skip It](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip-It).


i haven’t thought about these in 25 years. Being a 90’s kid that was raised by the TV, it immediately brought the jingle from the commercial to my mind.


Naturally, I had to find the video on YouTube. Here it is in all of it’s nostalgic glory.
