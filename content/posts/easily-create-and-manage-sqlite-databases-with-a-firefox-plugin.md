If you are doing any Mac, iPhone, HTML5, etc… developement, you have probably had the need for an sqlite database. So, you fire up your Terminal and start manully typing commands to do CREATEs and INSERTs.


You soon realize that this sucks and wish you had something like (*shudders*) PHPMyAdmin to manage your database. Well, now you do and it’s actually a lot less hiddeous than PHPMyAdmin.


Using the [SQLite Manager plugin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/5817) for Firefox, you can quickly CREATE, MODIFY, and DELETE sqlite databases visually. It’s very simple to use and makes the task of database creation a lot less painful.
