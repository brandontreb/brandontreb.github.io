[Apple says they&#39;re removing my game because it&#39;s more than 2 years old](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31135972)

This HN thread really resonated with me. I have been building and publishing iOS apps since the dawn of the App Store in 2008. In those 14 years, I have shipped over 200 apps, and do you want to know how many are still in the App Store? **Zero**. 

Some of these takedowns are due to startups failing or clients deciding to go in another direction, but still quite a few are forced out due to Apple’s update policy. 

It’s a strange feeling knowing that everything I have built for the past decade and a half has just disappeared into obsolescence. 

While I understand that Apple needs to continue to push their techbology forward, I would at least love to see them keep apps for posterity, albeit not searchable. This could satisfy their algorithmic search goals while still allowing developers to preserve their history.
