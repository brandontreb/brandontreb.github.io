It’s been a while, but I finally posted part 3 of the [iPhone Game Programming tutorial](http://icodeblog.com/2009/03/18/iphone-game-programming-tutorial-part-3-splash-screen/) series on [iCodeblog.com](http://iCodeblog.com). The focus of this tutorial was to create a splash page for your game that fades into your game’s main view.


I chose to create this tutorial after seeing many games that just jump right in to the main game play. A splash page makes the game feel more “professional” as well as gives the developer a chance to brand the app by displaying a company logo or something to that extent.


Hopefully, I will be able to get part 4 up in a timely fashion to teach developers how to incorporate sounds into their games.


So, go ahead and check out part 3 of the [iPhone Game Programming Tutorial Series](http://icodeblog.com/2009/03/18/iphone-game-programming-tutorial-part-3-splash-screen/).
