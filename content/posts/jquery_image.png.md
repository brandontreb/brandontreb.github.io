#### What?

Have you ever noticed that the content on [Mashable.com][2] loads Incredibly fast? Also, have you noticed that as you scroll the images seem to &#8216;fade&#8217; in? Well, this isn&#8217;t due to some crazy h4x0r code written specifically by Mashable Engineers. It&#8217;s a simple JQuery plugin that loads the images &#8216;Lazily&#8217;.

The Jquery plugin can be found [here][3] and a nice tutorial for implementing it can be found [here][4].

If you don&#8217;t feel like hacking it yourself, read on and I will point you in the direction of a great WordPress plugin that handles this automagically.

#### Where?

Luckily the hard work has been done for you and you can [download a WordPress plugin][5] that will automatically add this functionality to your WordPress blog.

You can [download the plugin from WordPress.org][5]

This plugin will work for EVERY image on your blog. Even the Gravatar icons of the commenters.

#### Thats It?

Yep, try it out. Just scroll down on my homepage and watch as the images magically fade in.

Happy Wp-ing!
