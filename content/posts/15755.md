So, after announcing that I was posting to micro.blog on my main [brandontreb.com](http://brandontreb.com), I had 79 unsubscribes from my email list.It also might have had something to do with the fact that I hadn’t posted in over a year.Maybe I’m do for the “Sorry I haven’t posted in a while” blog posts.
