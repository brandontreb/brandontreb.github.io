As of recent I have had a ton of interest in doing development for Jailbroken iPhones. I love the power, being able to hack *anything* on the device. It opens up a whole new world of possibilities.


My most current project (inPulseNotifier) is a Mobile Substrate hack which allows the iPhone to interface with an [inPulse watch](http://getinpulse.com). It uses BTStack and boots up during the init method of your springboard. I will do a full writeup on this in the near future, but basically it forwards all of your phone’s notifications (SMS, Local, Push, Calendar) to your watch!


#### Serious Lack Of Resources


InPulseNotifier was a blast to create, however I found it **incredibly** challenging to find many resources about doing jailbroken development. I finally found [theos](http://iphonedevwiki.net/index.php/Theos/Getting_Started) which was a total lifesaver. Also, I had the code for [mobileNotifier](http://www.peterhajas.com/blog/2011/2/27/mobilenotifier-beta3-copious-corn-flakes-1.html) to follow along with.


IRC (yeah I’m a true hacker ;)) was also huge help, but there simply aren’t enough tutorials/examples on the web related to jailbroken iPhone dev. My guesses are either 1. it’s quite hard, 2. there’s not enough <font color"green">$$$ in it, or 3. jailbreakers like to stay “underground”.


I haven’t quite figured it out, but I was curious what YOU thought about it as I’m considering doing some jailbroken iOS development tutorials on my blog. Please let me know in the comments. Are you down to “Hack the planet”?
