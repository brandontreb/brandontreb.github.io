As of recent I have had a ton of interest in doing development for Jailbroken iPhones. I love the power, being able to hack *anything* on the device. It opens up a whole new world of possibilities.

My most current project (inPulseNotifier) is a Mobile Substrate hack which allows the iPhone to interface with an [inPulse watch][1]. It uses BTStack and boots up during the init method of your springboard. I will do a full writeup on this in the near future, but basically it forwards all of your phone&#8217;s notifications (SMS, Local, Push, Calendar) to your watch!

#### Serious Lack Of Resources

InPulseNotifier was a blast to create, however I found it **incredibly** challenging to find many resources about doing jailbroken development. I finally found [theos][2] which was a total lifesaver. Also, I had the code for [mobileNotifier][3] to follow along with.

IRC (yeah I&#8217;m a true hacker ;)) was also huge help, but there simply aren&#8217;t enough tutorials/examples on the web related to jailbroken iPhone dev. My guesses are either 1. it&#8217;s quite hard, 2. there&#8217;s not enough <font color"green">$$$</font> in it, or 3. jailbreakers like to stay &#8220;underground&#8221;.

I haven&#8217;t quite figured it out, but I was curious what YOU thought about it as I&#8217;m considering doing some jailbroken iOS development tutorials on my blog. Please let me know in the comments. Are you down to &#8220;Hack the planet&#8221;?
