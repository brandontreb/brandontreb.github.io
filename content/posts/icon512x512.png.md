    <a href="/uploads/2010/icon512x512.png"></a>I have recently been developing an iPhone app in my free time called <a href="http://bit.ly/bkOfAT">Calculator Creator</a>. This application has been an idea of mine for quite some time and I finally found the time to complete it. Here is the complete description of the app.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The last calculation app you will need to buy!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    With Calculator Creator, you are easily able to build your own &#8220;Calculators&#8221; as long as you know their equations. The process couldn&#8217;t be easier.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Simply:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    1. Name your calculator (ex Cost Per Square Foot)<br /> 2. Add the fields involved (ex Cost, Square Foot)<br /> 3. Create the equation (ex Cost/Square Foot)<br /> 4. Use the calculator whenever you like
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Why purchase a unit conversion application for more, when you could have EVERY unit conversion in one clean application.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Calculator Creator also comes packed with over 20 sample calculators including:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    &#8211; Unit Conversions<br /> &#8211; Mortgage Payments Calculator<br /> &#8211; Temperature Conversions<br /> &#8211; Tip Calculators<br /> &#8211; and more!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If you are reading this and want a free copy of my Calculator Creator, try using one of the promo codes below. Also, please consider leaving me an iTunes review (especially if you are getting the app for free! :))
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I would love to hear suggestions for future improvements and features.
