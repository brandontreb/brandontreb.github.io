So, after my 6 year relationship with WordPress, I have been having some strong feelings for another (blog engine). [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) does everything that I want my wordpress to do.


1. Not suck at security
2. Not be bloated
3. Not have a sucky post editor
4. Expense – I have a few blogs hosted on Rackspace and my bill has gotten pretty pricey. I’m hoping to host my Jekyll site on App Engine for frizzle (free).


That’s about it. In case you live in a box (which most of us do since most houses are relatively square) and haven’t hear of it, Jekyll is a new blogging engine written in Ruby. Simply put, you write posts, run a command and it spits out static pages. You just upload these pages to your server (how old skool right?) Now you no longer have a dependancies on any server side language, fancy server configs, etc…


Jekyll has no(minimal) features, no comments, track backs etc… and no built-in SEO. It doesn’t even have an admin (since you are serving up static content). Sounds like a blast right? I’ll blog a bit about it as I make the migration and you will see, it’s going to be great!


I just finished reading [this post](http://vitobotta.com/how-to-migrate-from-wordpress-to-jekyll/) from Hacker News, which was pretty much the nail in the coffin.
