So, after my 6 year relationship with WordPress, I have been having some strong feelings for another (blog engine). [Jekyll][1] does everything that I want my wordpress to do.

  1. Not suck at security
  2. Not be bloated
  3. Not have a sucky post editor
  4. Expense &#8211; I have a few blogs hosted on Rackspace and my bill has gotten pretty pricey. I&#8217;m hoping to host my Jekyll site on App Engine for frizzle (free).

That&#8217;s about it. In case you live in a box (which most of us do since most houses are relatively square) and haven&#8217;t hear of it, Jekyll is a new blogging engine written in Ruby. Simply put, you write posts, run a command and it spits out static pages. You just upload these pages to your server (how old skool right?) Now you no longer have a dependancies on any server side language, fancy server configs, etc&#8230;

Jekyll has no(minimal) features, no comments, track backs etc&#8230; and no built-in SEO. It doesn&#8217;t even have an admin (since you are serving up static content). Sounds like a blast right? I&#8217;ll blog a bit about it as I make the migration and you will see, it&#8217;s going to be great!

I just finished reading [this post][2] from Hacker News, which was pretty much the nail in the coffin.
