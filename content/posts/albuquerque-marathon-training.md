<img class="alignright" title="albuquerque-marathon" src="http://www.active.com/images/upimages/Logo554.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="288" />Well, I have finally decided to put my money where my mouth is when it comes to fitness and train up for a half marathon! The marathon I&#8217;m training for is the [Albuquerque Half Marathon][1] on Saturday, April 16th at 8 am (that logo is such an eyesore).

Two months seems like a relatively short time to prepare, especially for my first &#8220;real&#8221; run, however I am just aiming to finish rather than being competitive. Right now, I am running about 3-4 miles per day with a longer day of ~5 miles. As the weeks pass, I intend on upping that to ~5 miles/day with a longer run at about 10 miles.

If any of you are training for something similar, I would love any advice, feedback, criticism, encouragement, stories, etc&#8230; that you have. Just post em in the comments.

Also, for those of you who are on **nike+**, please befriend me. My username is (you guessed it) **brandontreb**.

I&#8217;m very excited about this goal and will be blogging along the way (amidst my other coding related posts of course).

**It&#8217;s a long road ahead ðŸ˜‰**
