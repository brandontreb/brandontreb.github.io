![](/uploads/2011/Logo554.jpg "albuquerque-marathon")Well, I have finally decided to put my money where my mouth is when it comes to fitness and train up for a half marathon! The marathon I‚Äôm training for is the [Albuquerque Half Marathon](http://www.active.com/running/albuquerque-nm/albuquerque-half-marathon-2011) on Saturday, April 16th at 8 am (that logo is such an eyesore).


Two months seems like a relatively short time to prepare, especially for my first ‚Äúreal‚Äù run, however I am just aiming to finish rather than being competitive. Right now, I am running about 3-4 miles per day with a longer day of ~5 miles. As the weeks pass, I intend on upping that to ~5 miles/day with a longer run at about 10 miles.


If any of you are training for something similar, I would love any advice, feedback, criticism, encouragement, stories, etc‚Ä¶ that you have. Just post em in the comments.


Also, for those of you who are on **nike+**, please befriend me. My username is (you guessed it) **brandontreb**.


I‚Äôm very excited about this goal and will be blogging along the way (amidst my other coding related posts of course).


**It‚Äôs a long road ahead üòâ**
