As the new year kicks off in full swing, I am reflecting on [my 2015 goals](http://brandontreb.com/goals-for-2015/) and setting some new ones for 2016.


Here is how I did on each of last year’s goals:


* **Create a business plan** - Fail. I did not create a business plan for Pixegon.  This might have to carry over.
* **Grow Pixegon (my mobile consultancy) to 2x 2014 revenue** - Success. We not only achieved this goal, but surpassed it. Pixegon did a total of $1.1mm in revenue in 2015!
* **Hire a “director” -**Success. OK, so this one is sort of in the middle. I didn't quite hire a director per se, however I did elevate my senior employees to more management roles. This allows them to take some of the day to day tasks off of my plate.
* **Move to a weekly -**Fail. But I'm OK with it. This isn't very important.
* **Morning Routine** - Moderate. Some days were better than others
* **Blog twice a month -**Huge Fail.  I averaged .41 times per month.
* **Take off / reduce workload -**Success. More camping!
* **Give away more than 10% of personal income -**Success. Our family was blessed with multiple opportunities throughout the year to be a blessing to others in addition to our normal donations.


Overall, I'd call 2015 a success. I managed to hit the goals I felt most passionate about, and more importantly, this exercise has helped me to determine what I should focus on.  With that being said here are my goals for 2016.
* **Professional**
	+ Land **ONE** new client.  Sounds crazy I know, but allow me to explain.  Pixegon has been fortunate enough to work with some [pretty incredible clients](http://www.pixegon.com/more-works).  Many of these clients trust us to be their primary dev team throughout the year. I intend on finding at least ONE more client like these in 2016 (Referrals welcome ;) ).
	+ Build Something New. As I continue to build a company, it's often hard to get back to my roots of writing code and actually creating something. I miss this. It provided so much value to me over the course of the years. So, this year, I want build some "side projects".
	+ Hire. I hope to grow the team by at least 20% this year.  ([We are always hiring most positions](http://www.pixegon.com/join-our-team/)).
* **Personal**
	+ Be more intentional about EVERYTHING.  I have really been into a few blogs lately ([Mr Money Mustache](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com), [The Minimalists](http://www.theminimalists.com), [4-Hour Workweek](http://fourhourworkweek.com/blog/), etc...).  What I have really learned is that I want to be more intentional about everything I do (Family, Time, Money, etc...).  Part of this is removing my dependency on my phone, simplifying my life, and scheduling undivided time for the things that are important.
	+ Stop Complaining. I read this incredible book called [A Complaint Free World](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0770436390/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0770436390&linkCode=as2&tag=codnerandnon-20&linkId=JCWEFBN6BTYDX2OC) . He talks about the power of Not complaining. This has really resonated with me.
	+ Blog Twice Per Month. OK This time I mean it (1 down, 23 to go! )
	+ Read 5 books. Arbitrary amount I know, but I need something measurable.


That's it. Here's to a healthy and productive 2016!
