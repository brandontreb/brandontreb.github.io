So I received an internal email at work the other day about how we could SEO our company website (<http://elctech.com>). Here was my suggestion:

> &#8220;Just put up a few <h1> tags that state (in this order) Rails, Coding, Consulting, Porn, Free Porn, Porn on Rails, Viagra, iPhone, development, hot chicks, elc.
> 
> Guaranteed hits!&#8221;

Genius right? So after a while, a fellow employee ([@maxmurphy][1]) suggested we implement this rails solution:

<div>
  <pre>&lt;code class=’ruby’>["Rails", "Coding", "Consulting", "Porn", "Free Porn", "Porn on Rails", "Viagra",
"iPhone", "development", "hot chicks", "elc"].each do |seo|
  "#{seo} \n ELC ROCKS #{seo}"
end&lt;/code></pre>
</div>

Perfect!

Feel free to steal this and you too can be an SEO Guru!
