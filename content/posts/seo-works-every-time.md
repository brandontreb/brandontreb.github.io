So I received an internal email at work the other day about how we could SEO our company website (<http://elctech.com>). Here was my suggestion:



> 
> “Just put up a few #  tags that state (in this order) Rails, Coding, Consulting, Porn, Free Porn, Porn on Rails, Viagra, iPhone, development, hot chicks, elc.
> 
> 
> 
> 
> Guaranteed hits!”

Genius right? So after a while, a fellow employee ([@maxmurphy](http://twitter.com/maxmurphy)) suggested we implement this rails solution:




```
<code class=’ruby’>["Rails", "Coding", "Consulting", "Porn", "Free Porn", "Porn on Rails", "Viagra",
"iPhone", "development", "hot chicks", "elc"].each do |seo|
  "#{seo} \n ELC ROCKS #{seo}"
end</code>
```


Perfect!


Feel free to steal this and you too can be an SEO Guru!
