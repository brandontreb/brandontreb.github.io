My wife has this interesting problem of having vivid dreams about whatever she was last watching/discussing before bed. Last night, I was explaining to her all about memory leaks as I had a discussion with a coworker earlier in the day about them. She was curious, so I gave her a very simple explanation in which she could understand.


Later in the night (about 3 am), my son woke up screaming. He must have had a bad dream or something; so, I went in there, put him down and went back to bed. My wife rolls over, looks me straight in the eye and says in a groggy voice “Does he have a memory leak?”


I laughed so hard it woke her up. I then appropriately responded with “I have to go take a memory leak”.
