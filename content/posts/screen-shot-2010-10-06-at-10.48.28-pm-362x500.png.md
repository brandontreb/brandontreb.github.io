After a week of studying my butt off with OpenGL ES, I have finally started work on my game engine for my [Pov&#8217;s Challenge][1] game.

As you can tell from the screenshot below, I have been playing entirely too much Minecraft and have cube art on the brain.

It&#8217;s not much right now, but I do have a basic cube rendering engine that takes in a level file and renders the environment. Here is a screenshot of a very simple level.

[<img class="size-medium wp-image-962 alignleft" title="Screen shot 2010-10-06 at 10.48.28 PM" src="/uploads/2010/Screen-shot-2010-10-06-at-10.48.28-PM-362x500.png" alt="" width="290" height="400" />][2]It&#8217;s not looking super killer at the moment, but I have yet to do fancier lighting or any texture mapping.

**Ohh My Game Idea You Ask?**

Well, without going into too much detail, it&#8217;s pretty much an epic battle of mass proportion set in a 3D cube environment (hint: it&#8217;s not iMinecraft ;)).

I will give more details as I go about the month and near the completion of my game.

Also, in case you are interested, here is what the level file looks like for the generated environment.

<pre><strong>GG,GG,GG,G,GG,GG,GG
GG,G,G,G,G,G,GG
GG,G,G,G,G,G,GG
GG,G,G,G,G,G,GG
G,G,G,GG,G,G,G
GG,G,G,G,G,G,GG
GG,G,G,G,G,G,GG
GG,G,G,G,G,G,GG
GG,GG,GG,G,GG,GG,GG</strong></pre>

The number of G&#8217;s that appear represent the height at that location.

**The current roadmap is:**

  * Texturing & Lighting
  * Collision Detection / Navigation
  * Gameplay & Audio
  * AI
  * Menus / Title / Pause ([secret sauce ingredients][3])

By next week, I should have some sort of level editor and some basic skinning going on.

Hopefully I can finish this sucker by the end of the month. Its&#8217;s been an intense journey learning openGL from scratch in 7 days and I know that I still have quite a ways to go. Again, if you are participating in this challenge, link me to your development blog in the comments.

Happy coding!
