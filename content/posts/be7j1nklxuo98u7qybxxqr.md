I went on my first [ruck](https://www.goruck.com/pages/what-is-rucking) today inspired by [this episode](https://overcast.fm/+KebuKQO0A) of the Tim Ferris podcast with Dr. Kelly Starrett. I didnâ€™t have a proper backpack, so I just filled the Osprey up with about 30lbs of rocks.


I really enjoyed it and felt that it gave me a great (easy) workout.
