I absolutely **hate** scoping projects.  It&#39;s such uninteresting / uninspiring work.  

It&#39;s ironic because scoping generally translates to work/dollars, so it&#39;s a critical part of my business.

Also, I can&#39;t outsource this task. I don&#39;t trust anyone to do it correctly and accurately
