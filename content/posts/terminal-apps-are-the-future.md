I **LOVE** the idea of taking modern web apps to the Terminal.  As a heavy user of ssh, tmux, screen, etc... the idea of seldom leaving the terminal seems very romantic.

There was a recent [Show HN Post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31154567) about a small app called [lists.sh](https://lists.sh/) that really caught my attention. 

The first _very_ interesting aspect of this technology is it uses [Public Key Cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography) to establish user accounts. No emails, no passwords, high security.  

Another really interesting part of this software is posts are made by using a simple [scp](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E26502_01/html/E29001/remotehowtoaccess-55154.html) command to publish the lists.

Finally, everything is text-based (obviously)! I feel like the web continues to move towards heavy UI with dependency on many JS frameworks (which I still love ;) ), but there is something so refreshing about seeing such a minimal publishing interface using tools that are built into all machines.

I really hope this trend continues and we start to see everything from blog engines to social networks existing solely in the terminal.
