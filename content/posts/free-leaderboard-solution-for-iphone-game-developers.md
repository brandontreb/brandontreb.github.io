What makes most multiplayer games more exciting that single player games? It’s competition! People love to compete with eachother.


And how can competition be achieved in single player games? [Leaderboards](http://iphonelb.com).


A leaderboard is basically a table ranking players based on their scores in the game. This allows players to see how they stack up against other players.


**The Problem**


Many programmers either know how to do web development or system development. They don’t know both and certainly don’t know how to integrate the two. This is why I believe there are not more single player games with leaderboards in the App Store.


**The Solution** 


This is where [iPhone Leaderboards](http://iphonelb.com) comes in. It’s an online hosted leaderboard that is incredibly easy to integrate with any iPhone game. The code to integrate with iPhoneLB is given to you to paste directly into your own. It couldn’t be easier.


Try it out and let me know what you think!
