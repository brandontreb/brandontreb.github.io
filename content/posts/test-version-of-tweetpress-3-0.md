So WordPress 3.0 has broken Tweetpress for many people. If you are daring, willing to help, and experiencing issues with Tweetpress, please download the 3.0 test build of Tweetpress and install it on your WordPress blog.


Here are your next steps after installation:


1. Make sure you add your Twitter username and Password to the Tweetpress settings in your wp-admin and save it
2. Attempt to post a photo to Twitter using Twitter for iPhone
3. If it works, you win, let me know, if not do this:
	1. go back to the tweetpress admin in wp-admin
	2. click the log link at the very bottom
	3. copy the text and email it to brandontreb [at] gmail [dot] com with the subject “Tweetpress Log”


This will really help me troubleshoot the issues that everyone has been having.


Thanks!
