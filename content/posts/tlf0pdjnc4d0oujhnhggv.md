Anyone who had participated in crypto for a significant amount of time, has a story or two about missed opportunity or even loss. This is my story.


In 2016, a client of mine asked me to build them a DApp (distributed app) on the Ethereum blockchain. At that time, ETH was trading around $100 USD per coin.


The client, being super into crypto, offered to pay me in Ethereum only. [My consultancy](https://pixegon.com) was already doing fairly well at the time and I didn’t *really* need the money from the contract (around $100k USD). This would have amounted to me acquiring around 1,000 ETH. But, still being skeptical of crypto, I declined his offer and took the cash instead.


**Huge mistake.**


As many if your might know, at the crypto peak in 2022, Ethereum was trading at around $4,500 USD per coin.


Doing the math, that contract would now be worth over $4.5 million USD! 🤦‍♂️


I honestly don’t regret the decision to take the cash, as I now have a great story to tell. I love telling my kids and them telling me what a complete idiot I am.


I guess I’ll have to wait a little longer on buying the Lambo.


*Do you have a crazy crypto story? I’d love to hear about it.*
