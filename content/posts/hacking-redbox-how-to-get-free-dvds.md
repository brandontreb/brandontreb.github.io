I was at Wally-World the other day getting a movie from RedBox with my wife when I noticed some guy enter in a code into the machine. The code was BREAKROOM. After watching him for a moment, I realized this code entitled him a free DVD rental.


Now, RedBox is pretty stinking cheap ($1.50/night), but if you’re an avid movie watcher, this really adds up.


So, I did some searching on the Google machine and sure enough, there are new RedBox codes that go into circulation every day. Each one giving you a free DVD.


The site that offers the RedBox codes is <http://www.insideredbox.com/redbox-codes/>


Users submit the codes and update the site with the last time they were used. That way, you always know which codes are currently working.


You simply need to enter the coupon code from the main screen or just before checkout at your local Redbox kiosk. When you do, you will receive a one-day free rental. Any additional days you keep the movie will be charged at the usual $1.50/day.


Update: [@diemer](http://twitter.com/diemer) on Twitter pointed out to me that inside Redbox also has an iPhone app. The link for the app is <http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/inside-redbox-pro/id306217360?mt=8>


I may actually cancel my Netflix account now…
