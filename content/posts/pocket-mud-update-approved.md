[![](/uploads/2010/iPhone-Screenshot-1.jpeg "iPhone Screenshot 1")](http://bit.ly/eazB6u)Wow, in record time (2 business days!), Apple approved the update to my iPhone app [Pocket Mud](http://bit.ly/eazB6u). For those of you who donâ€™t know, Pocket MUD is my FREE MUD client for the iPhone.


Here is whats included in the update:


* Added support for Landscape!
* Auto-reconnect on reopen
* Multiple actions for triggers (just separate the actions with commas)
* Added ability to play sounds when a trigger fires (please send sound suggestions to [brandontreb@gmail.com](mailto:brandontreb@gmail.com))


The app is free, so please check it out and leave some (positive) feedback! ![:)](/uploads/2010/simple-smile.png)
