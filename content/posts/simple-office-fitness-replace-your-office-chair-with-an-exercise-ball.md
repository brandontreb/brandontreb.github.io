When I was in Portland this past month, I saw that many people in my workâ€™s office were sitting on large exercise balls instead of office chairs. Curious, I researched the benefits and decided to [purchase one](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FH2W4A?ie=UTF8&tag=codnerandnon-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000FH2W4A) for my home office. The benefits include:



* Improved posture â€“ sitting on the ball forces you to sit up straight of you wonâ€™t be very comfortable
* Constant movement â€“ Sitting for long periods of time can be bad for you, even when you exercise. Check out this [recent study](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/14/phys-ed-the-men-who-stare-at-screens/) that was discussed on the New York Times. When you use an exercise ball for a chair, you are constantly repositioning yourself and are combatting this issue.
* Getting Jacked! â€“ having a ball for a chair has encouraged me to exercise during my down time. Code is compilingâ€¦bang out some crunches. I will now do ~ 300 crunches per day while waiting for various tasks to complete.
* They are cheap â€“ Most exercise balls range from $15-$25. [Check out Amazon for some deals](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FH2W4A?ie=UTF8&tag=codnerandnon-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000FH2W4A). I recently purchased one at Target on sale for $9.
* Itâ€™s fun â€“ Need a break? Just bounce a bit on the ball ðŸ˜‰


While Iâ€™m not saying to completely replace your office chair with an exercise ball (you will end up switching back an fourth a bit), it is a great way to stay in shape and enforce good posture while at work.
