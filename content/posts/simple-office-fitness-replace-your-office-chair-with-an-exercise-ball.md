  <a href="http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/513N0EDXN5L._SS500_.jpeg"></a>When I was in Portland this past month, I saw that many people in my work&#8217;s office were sitting on large exercise balls instead of office chairs. Curious, I researched the benefits and decided to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FH2W4A?ie=UTF8&tag=codnerandnon-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000FH2W4A" target="_blank">purchase one</a> for my home office. The benefits include:
</p>

  * Improved posture &#8211; sitting on the ball forces you to sit up straight of you won&#8217;t be very comfortable
  * Constant movement &#8211; Sitting for long periods of time can be bad for you, even when you exercise. Check out this [recent study][1] that was discussed on the New York Times. When you use an exercise ball for a chair, you are constantly repositioning yourself and are combatting this issue.
  * Getting Jacked! &#8211; having a ball for a chair has encouraged me to exercise during my down time. Code is compiling&#8230;bang out some crunches. I will now do ~ 300 crunches per day while waiting for various tasks to complete.
  * They are cheap &#8211; Most exercise balls range from $15-$25. [Check out Amazon for some deals][2]. I recently purchased one at Target on sale for $9.
  * It&#8217;s fun &#8211; Need a break? Just bounce a bit on the ball 😉

While I&#8217;m not saying to completely replace your office chair with an exercise ball (you will end up switching back an fourth a bit), it is a great way to stay in shape and enforce good posture while at work.
