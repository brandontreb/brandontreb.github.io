I used to be an Emacs guy and would battle to the death on the war between Vim and Emacs. It wasn‚Äôt until a coworker of mine sat down and really showed me just how cool/simple/powerful Vim can be. Just using Vim is a new adventure every day and has really improved my productivity. I now use it to code, blog, and even jot down quick notes.


Last week, I saw on Hacker News a link announcing [Vim has been ported to iOS](http://applidium.com/en/applications/vim/). I have spent a week or so with it and can honestly say the port is almost perfect!

It has *most* of the major Vim features and commands including:


* Automatic indentation
* Visual mode (block operations)
* Language-aware syntax highlighting
* Integrated scripting language that lets you extend functionalities
* Macros recording and playback
* Markers management (to quickly move around the edited file)
* Multiple clipboards


You even have access to the config file to remap keys and define your own custom macros.


There are a few features that would make this better on mobile however:


1. Dropbox Support ‚Äì Currently you must use iTunes to work with Vim documents on mobile. There needs to be an easier way to share these.
2. Keyboard bar ‚Äì Since you have to switch modes so frequently and there are some keys you type often ( ‚Äú:‚Äù ), it would be nice to have quick access to these.
3. Plugin support ‚Äì This is an Apple limitation ![:(](/uploads/2012/frownie.png)
4. NERDTree ‚Äì The file browser that‚Äôs built in doesn‚Äôt work too well.


With Vim mobile, you can now look *even more* nerdy on your iPhone üòâ
