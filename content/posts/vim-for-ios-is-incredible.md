I used to be an Emacs guy and would battle to the death on the war between Vim and Emacs. It wasn&#8217;t until a coworker of mine sat down and really showed me just how cool/simple/powerful Vim can be. Just using Vim is a new adventure every day and has really improved my productivity. I now use it to code, blog, and even jot down quick notes.

Last week, I saw on Hacker News a link announcing [Vim has been ported to iOS][1]. I have spent a week or so with it and can honestly say the port is almost perfect!

It has *most* of the major Vim features and commands including:

  * Automatic indentation
  * Visual mode (block operations)
  * Language-aware syntax highlighting
  * Integrated scripting language that lets you extend functionalities
  * Macros recording and playback
  * Markers management (to quickly move around the edited file)
  * Multiple clipboards

You even have access to the config file to remap keys and define your own custom macros.

There are a few features that would make this better on mobile however:

  1. Dropbox Support &#8211; Currently you must use iTunes to work with Vim documents on mobile. There needs to be an easier way to share these.
  2. Keyboard bar &#8211; Since you have to switch modes so frequently and there are some keys you type often ( &#8220;:&#8221; ), it would be nice to have quick access to these.
  3. Plugin support &#8211; This is an Apple limitation <img src="http://brandontreb.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />
  4. NERDTree &#8211; The file browser that&#8217;s built in doesn&#8217;t work too well.

With Vim mobile, you can now look *even more* nerdy on your iPhone 😉
