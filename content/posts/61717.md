[This Episode](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6dMVMejS0LwF3us4oYIInd?si=7jlwpxzgS2-KNaXSWfj3Ug) of the Joe Rogan Podcast with Erika Thomson is awesome!

She talks all about bees üêù and beekeeping. It‚Äôs fascinating to learn how complex and amazing bee colonies are. 

Definitely makes me want to add beekeeping to my ever growing list of hobbies!
