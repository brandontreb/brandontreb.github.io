For this month's [retro game](https://brandontreb.com/monthly-retro-game-club/), I started playing [The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening DX](https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/the-legend-of-zelda-links-awakening-dx-3ds/) on my [RG351V](https://a.co/d/8QA4R4X).

I absolutely LOVE this game and it looks gorgeous on this device.

I've played through most of Links Awakening on the original Gameboy hardware, however I never completed it due to the battery dying.

I'm excited to _finally_ play it all the way through!
