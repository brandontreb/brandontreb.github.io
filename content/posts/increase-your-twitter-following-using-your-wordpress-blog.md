[Download TwitPop Now](http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/twitpop.zip)


TwitPop is a WordPress plugin I wrote with one goal…To make you more popular on Twitter. There are sites that spring up from time to time claiming to get you more followers on Twitter if you follow X amount of people on the follow train. Well, now you can create your own Twitter train on your wordpress blog and really get more followers.



 The best part is, you add your username in the admin panel and EVERYONE FOLLOWS YOU! Think of the possibilities… You could be a Twitlebrity.




 To add to the excitement, everyone that uses your TwitPop plugin will Tweet a link back to your blog. This promotes your blog as well as your Twitter account. Check out how TwitPop works below.



**Instructions**


Log in to your Twitter account below. You will automatically follow the people that have visited this page before you (no more than 20).


Then, your Twitter username will be added to the list and you will be followed by the next 20 people to use this plugin.
