I am always very fascinated with the workspaces of others and frequently check out Lifehacker’s posts on their [featured workspaces](http://lifehacker.com/tag/featured-workspace/). So, for this iDevBlogADay post, I thought I would keep it short and simple with a request. I want to see (and I’m sure others do too) photos of YOUR workspaces (especially those of you with s[tanding desks](http://gamesfromwithin.com/my-standing-desk-experiment)).


Seeing someone’s work area is especially inspring to me, I love seeing where others create and what they surround themselves with for inspiration and motivation.


So, I’ll start by sharing a photo of my current workspace. This is where the magic happens…

Within my workspace, you will find:


* Macbook Pro
* 24” Apple LED Display
* iPad with Kensington Keyboard Case
* Logitec Speakers
* “Just Like Jesus” Daily Devotional
* Embark (Target Brand) Fitness Ball
* Apple wireless keyboard and Magic Mouse
* Bonsai Tree (coming soon ![:)](/uploads/2010/simple-smile.png) )


So there you have, this is my workspace. Please post a link to your workspace photos or email them to brandontreb [at] gmail [dot] com and I will append them to this post. I can’t wait!


Update: Here are some workspaces submitted by readers so far:
