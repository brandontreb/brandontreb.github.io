I literally found [forestry.io](https://forestry.io/) on the *exact* day they discontinued the product. It solves all of the CMS challenges I was facing for a client project. It’s too bad that I won’t be able to use them.


It looks like they are migrating to [tina.io](https://tina.io/) which appears to be a bit more complex.


Hopefully, I can use Tina in much the same way as Forestry.


Any CMS suggestions?
