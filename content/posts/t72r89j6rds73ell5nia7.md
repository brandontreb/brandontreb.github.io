My blog at [brandontreb.com](https://brandontreb.com) has been running my custom code for over 24 hours without catching on fire 🔥

There is something that feels  _really_ special about using my own software to participate in the Indie Web.

Once I’m not embarrassed by the code, I’ll def open source it!
