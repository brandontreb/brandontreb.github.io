My wife and I got *complementary* tattoos.


I have made it 37 years on this planet without getting a single tattoo. A few weeks back, I went with Ashley to her tattoo appointment. She wanted to get a phrase from one of her favorite books tattooed on her arm and a Boba Fett helmet on her finger.


When we arrived, she said she had a surprise for me, but I couldn’t know until the artist started. After she got her first two tattoos, the artist began on a third.


As the words were materializing, I recognized the lyrics from a song called [Piece of Your Heart](https://spotify.link/Fpp2dLnYRDb) by Mayday Parade, which is my favorite band of all time.


The lyrics said “You are the brightest I’ve seen”.


Being so incredibly touched by this, I impulsively asked the artist if he could tattoo the next line of the lyric on my arm. He agreed and I got “You are the best side of me” on my arm.


It was an absolutely beautiful experience to share with my wife and I couldn’t be happier.
