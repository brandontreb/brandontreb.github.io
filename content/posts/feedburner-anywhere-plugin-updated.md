I have updated my WordPress plugin Feedburner Anywhere. In case you are unfamiliar with it, itâ€™s a plugin that allows you to output your Feedburner subscriber count anywhere on your blog.


\*\*The Problem: \*\*Since Google took over Feedburner, I feel that it has been quite unreliable. A few times a week, Feedburner would return 0 for your subscriber count. This was an issue with the plugin. If the return value was 0 when the plugin pulled and cached the feedburner data, you would look like you had no subscribers.


**The Fix:** I am now caching the values returned from Feedburner. If for any reason Feedburner returns a 0 subscriber count, the last known value (greater than 0) is used instead.

If you have any other suggestions for the plugin, please let me know.
