Recently [TopCoder.com](http://TopCoder.com) posted a list of algorithm tutorials from some of their “top coders”.


The tutorials are very comprehensive and pretty much sum my undergraduate computer science degree up in one page ![:)](/uploads/2009/simple-smile.png) This page is a great resource for anyone that does any amount of coding…


Some of the tutorials include:


* Greedy algorithms
* Various sort and search techniques
* Data structures
* Graph theory


Here is the link to the Top Coder Tutorials:
