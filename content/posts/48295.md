Our team has launched our first DApp on the Ethereum test net for a client.  Building a solidity / blockchain app has been more fun that anything I have worked on since the early days of iOS dev. I recommend checking out [Crypto Zombies](http://cryptozombies.io) if you are interested in learning solidity.
