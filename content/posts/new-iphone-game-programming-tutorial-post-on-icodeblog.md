Well, it had taken me a while to slot in the time, but I finally finished part 2 of the iPhone Game Programming series iTennis on iCodeBlog.com . The game is shaping up to be pretty cool and I am really enjoying teaching about game programming. 

I think that game programming is perfect for teaching people how to program a certain language. This is because games generally encompasses many aspects of programming (interface, logic, math, animation, AI, etc&#8230;). The only problem is, they take forever to code/teach. Here are the links for the iPhone Game Programming Tutorials Series:
