Rates are a weird thing and chances are, yours are too low. 

I spent years stressing about rates. I would always start strong and but then eventually get talked down (usually by myself). 

I think rates go hand in hand with impostor sybdrom. “Why would anyone pay me _that much_”. It took me quite some time to over come this, however after many years, and multiple rate hikes, we are doing more business than ever. 

Raise your rates, now. You are worth it.
