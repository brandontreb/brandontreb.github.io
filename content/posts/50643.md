We got a pretty cool feature the other day on Daily Mail:

[New Mexico couple sell their home to travel America in a $33,000 converted school bus with their three children](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5656325/New-Mexico-couple-travel-America-33-000-converted-school-bus-children.html)

These things are usually pretty cool except they always mis quote us and “tweak” the details.
