    IBM's Watson on Jeopardy
  </p>
</div>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Last night marked the beginning of the <a href="http://www-943.ibm.com/innovation/us/watson/">IBM Jeopardy challenge</a>. For those of you who don&#8217;t know, IBM has been working for some time on a system (named Watson) that has overcome some amazing challenges. The goal: to build an entirely self-contained system that can beat the World&#8217;s best Jeopardy players.

Now, I&#8217;m not going to give you a rundown on it as I&#8217;m sure that you can (or have already) read it on a website far more popular than mine. I just wanted to publicly geek out for a second&#8230;

I was watching the episode of Jeopardy with my wife, and at first glance she was like &#8220;duh, of course a computer could win at Jeopardy&#8221;. This made me realize that to a non engineer, this seems like a trivial task since computers are magical Facebook boxes.

Now me on the other hand, I was giddy to the point of almost wetting myself. Seeing how far we have come in AI development and language processing is absolutely incredible.

I for one, will be glued to my tv tonight to watch Watson&#8217;s next round of Jeopardy.
