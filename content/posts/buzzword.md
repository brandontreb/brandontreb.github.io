### The ultimate party game has arrived in the App Store! If you are a fan of the game Catch-Phrase, then you will love Buzzword.


In this fast-paced game, do whatever it takes to get your team to guess the word or phrase. Give them clues – talk, use your hands, jump around. Once they guess, pass it quick. You don’t want to be caught with the game at the buzz. 


### Game Controls:


**Start/Stop** – Starts and stops the timer


\*\*Category \*\*– Selects a category


**Team1** – Awards a point to team 1


**Team 2** – Awards a point to team 2


\*\*Next \*\*– Selects the next word to describe


### Game Rules:


To play the game, players need to split up into two teams. You should sit in a circle alternating every other person as a member on your team.


First, the teams will need to decide on a category in which the words will come from. This is done by pressing the “Category” button. Next, pick a team to begin the game with the first word.


The game starts by pressing the “start/stop” button to start the timer. The player holding the iPhone/iPod will try to describe the word on the screen. They can say and do whatever they want without saying any of the words on the screen, saying “rhymes with”, or saying “starts with”. All of the members on their team will then try to guess the word or phrase the player is trying to describe.


Once the word has been guessed, the iPhone/iPod is passed to the next player on the opposite team. This player will press the “Next” button to receive a new word to describe.


The game is played until the buzzer goes off. At this point, the team NOT holding the iPhone/iPod gets a point. This is done by pressing either the “Team 1” or “Team 2” buttons. The first team to 7 wins!
