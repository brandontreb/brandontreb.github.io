I **love** “Blogging Is Not Dead” posts because I love to blog and often wonder if it’s a waste of time. It’s always reassuring to hear new perspectives on this topic and reaffirm the WHYs. 

I had a wildly successful blog in the early 2000’s which I sold for almost nothing (I was a broke college kid and didn’t understand business) and have yet to recreate that sort of blogging success. 

It’s helpful to recognize that these days that I probably won’t be a prominent blogger again but that doesn’t mean blogging can’t be an important part of my life. 

I blog now for these reasons:

- Learning New concepts
- Mental Clarity
- Improve communication skills
- Build Community  
- Fun
- ???
- _not_ profit

and I’m more than ok with that.
