I was having a conversation with my dad the other day and sharing some of my current business ideas with him.  I also mentioned that I often discuss new product/business ideas in public with other people.

His response was obviously “Why would you just give away your ideas?”.  I then proceeded to give him the &quot;Your Ideas Are Worthless Without Proper Execution” spiel.  

So, to put my money where my mouth is, I will be sharing my business ideas here; putting them out there in hopes that either a. I get valuable feedback/encouragement or b. someone else builds it and I get to use it. 

**Business idea**

So many people have RVs that are in use roughly 5% on the year.  The other 95% of the time, they sit in disrepair and usually cost the owner money to store them.

While many sites like [RVShare](https://rvshare.com/) exist that allow you to essentially &quot;rent out&quot; your RV, they still pose a huge challenge in that the RV must be physically located on the owner&#39;s property.   

I propose to build an RV storage facility where owners receive the following:

1. Free Storage
2. Free basic upkeep
3. Free cleaning
4. Profit Sharing
5. Insurance

In exchange for this, they allow us to rent their RV out at a price we set.  It would function much like RVShare in that would-be RVers reserve one of the RVs we have in our fleet and come pick it up. The RV would be ready to go with a full tank of water, full propane tanks, and a generator.

Once they return the RV, it gets cleaned and prepped for the next renter. Profits from the rental would be shared with the RV owner.

There you have it. I&#39;d love to [hear your thoughts](http://twitter.com/brandontreb) and I hope to be sharing more of these in the future.
