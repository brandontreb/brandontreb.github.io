**tl;dr Present yourself to potential clients as if you have already made it. Don&#8217;t be scared, the work it out there. Freelancing FTW!1!**

In the first week of December, I got a rather unfortunate (and unexpected) call from the CEO of the company I was working for. The gist of it was &#8220;we are reorganizing, and have decided to cut your position. Effective Immediately&#8221;. At this point, I was the Director Of Mobile Engineering and was making a very decent salary. While I was planning on leaving to go freelance at some point, I hadn&#8217;t dreamed it would be this sudden.

Well, it turns out that CEO did me one of the biggest favors of my life. He forced me to go indie. I probably would have flailed there for at least another year before even considering moving on.

I want to share a few things (good and bad) about what I have learned in the past month and how I will never (willingly) work for a company again.

## Panic Sets In

I had been working at the aforementioned company for the past 4 years. In fact, it was my first job out of college. So, you can imagine how scary and stressful it was going from a steady paycheck to nothing in the blink of an eye. What&#8217;s ironic about this is, many people I have talked to since going indie have told me that they wish they could do it too, but really like the &#8220;security&#8221; of their corporate job.

At first, I freaked out a little and took the day off (I was &#8220;let go&#8221; in the morning). But, the very next day I hit the ground running in search of a contract.

## Contracts, Contracts Everywhere

Much to my surprise, there are contracting opportunities **everywhere**. Again, I had to leave the company so soon, I hadn&#8217;t had time to research this myself beforehand. A simple Google search of &#8220;[your field] contract work&#8221; should reveal plenty (assuming your field is some sort of software. I can&#8217;t speak for other industries). I even started applying for salaried jobs as a contractor. You would be surprised how many companies are open to it.

This was immediately comforting.

## Talk The Talk

My first few days of looking for a contract were pretty interesting. Being that I had just been let go, I felt this intense pressure to land a contract right away. This definitely came through in how I related to the recruiters and people I spoke with. My good friend [Scott Caruso][1] sat down with me and gave me some of the most important advice I would hear for dealing with potential clients.

  1. You are looking for the &#8220;right opportunity&#8221;. If you are considering freelance, you obviously feel you are an expert (or close to) in your field and that definitely has value. Don&#8217;t settle for crappy contracts at crappy rates just because you need the money. You will hate life.

  2. Spam! During my first week, I would contact one or two people and they said they would get back to me. Well, I didn&#8217;t want to possibly have to tell them no later, so I would politely not communicate with anyone else until I heard back. That was dumb.  
    Finding contracts is like shopping at Goodwill. It&#8217;s mostly crap, but if you go through enough of the crap, you will find a gem.

  3. Leverage your existing contacts. This should be obvious. I was holding off on this early on as I didn&#8217;t want to sound lame. However, these are the people you can show a little desperation to as they are (or should be) your friends. That being said, someone always knows someone else that needs some work done. If I hadn&#8217;t done this, I for sure would have violated #1.

  4. You are a scarce resource (at least present yourself that way): Once I started telling recruiters that I was talking to tons of others and am planning on making a deal this week, I started getting a flood of them calling me back.

## The Bad

  1. Everything you do starts to get a price tag. The other day, I asked my wife to [make me a sandwichh][2]. She told me to make it myself, and I politely informed her that the 15 minutes spent doing that would cost us $25 so it had better be the best sandwhich I have ever made.  
      
    I am not sure if this feeling ever goes away (if you are a veteran freelance, I&#8217;d love to hear your thoughts).

  2. It&#8217;s a little scary knowing you don&#8217;t have a paycheck in X months (X being your current contract length). This was the most frightening thing at first. Now, it seems like an exciting challenge.

  3. Tendency to overwork: Since you now have money++ and can make more just by adding hours, you will be drawn to work more. I have talked to many others who end up leaving freelance because of burnout from working too much. Sure you made $30K in 2 weeks, but you are hating life.

## Summary

So far my journey as an independent iOS developer has been incredible. I am loving every minute of it and I encourage anyone interested in it to do the same. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s for the n00b or the non-self starter. [This post][3] I found on Hacker News has a brilliant step by step tutorial on moving in this direction.

I hope you have enjoyed yet another post on freelancing.

Thanks for reading!
