I spent last night presenting to our town’s Planning and Zoning commission (picture a courtroom with 6 judges and me standing at a podium) in order to obtain a short term rental permit for a house my wife and I recently renovated.


After about 1 full hour of discussion (among them, I’m not allowed to participate past my 3 minute presentation) around septic tanks, they finally ruled in favor of my permit.


It was a pseudo success as they added a condition that I upgrade the septic, which will cost north of $10K.


It was one of the more bizarre experiences of my life and I felt like I was in a real life episode of [Parks and Rec](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt1266020/).
