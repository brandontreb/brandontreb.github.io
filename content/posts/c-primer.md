I have **always** loved the C programming language. I remember being a young programmer (man that was 15 years ago) when I wrote my first C program. It seemed like absolute magic (and it still does).


Since then, I love (re)discovering the language every chance I get.


I found this post incredibly well done with some great examples. I wish we had resources like this "back in my day‚Äù.
