I have **always** loved the C programming language.  I remember being a young programmer (man that was 15 years ago) when I wrote my first C program.  It seemed like absolute magic (and it still does).  

Since then, I love (re)discovering the language every chance I get.

I found this post incredibly well done with some great examples. I wish we had resources like this &quot;back in my day‚Äù.
