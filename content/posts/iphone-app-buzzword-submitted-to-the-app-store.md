I have just submitted an iPhone app that I have been developing in my free time. The app is called Buzzword. It&#8217;s basically a game similar to the game catchphrase. So wherever you go, you and your friends can bust out a game of Buzzword&#8230;

Here are some screenshots:</p>

<img class="size-medium wp-image-35 alignnone" title="screenshot_2" src="http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/screenshot_2-300x200.png" alt="screenshot_2" width="300" height="200" />

Once approved, Buzzword will only cost a buck. I&#8217;m not kidding, it will probably be the best dollar you have spent and will spend in your entire life. Stay tuned, I&#8217;ll be giving out promo codes to people at random&#8230;
