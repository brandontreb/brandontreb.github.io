I have just submitted an iPhone app that I have been developing in my free time. The app is called Buzzword. It’s basically a game similar to the game catchphrase. So wherever you go, you and your friends can bust out a game of Buzzword…


Here are some screenshots:

Once approved, Buzzword will only cost a buck. I’m not kidding, it will probably be the best dollar you have spent and will spend in your entire life. Stay tuned, I’ll be giving out promo codes to people at random…
