So, it looks like [@paul@tapbots.social](https://tapbots.social/@paul) has [confirmed](https://tapbots.social/@paul/109695822047176004) that Twitter is shutting down API keys for 3rd party apps.

In addition to this change, they have completely removed the ability to sort the timeline chronologically. That was the only feature that made Twitter _somewhat_ usable.

In light of these changes, I have finally begun the process of downloading my archived Twitter data and moving off for good.
