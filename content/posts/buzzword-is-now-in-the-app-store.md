Well, after anxiously waiting for the past 6 days (feels like forever) I have finally gotten that magical email from Apple stating that my “application is ready for sale”. The application of course referring to a game I created called Buzzword.


Buzzword is essentially a clone of the popular party game CatchPhrase ported on to the iPhone.  [Click Her](http://brandontreb.com/buzzword/)e for all the details on Buzzword.


I am asking a huge favor to anyone that wants to participate. I will give you a free copy of Buzzword (wow saves you a whole buck) if you would kindly write a review of it on your blog or website. If you are interested, either post a comment in this post, [contact me](http://brandontreb.com/contact-me/), or hit me up on [Twitter.](http://twitter.com/brandontreb)
