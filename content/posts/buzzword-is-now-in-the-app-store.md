Well, after anxiously waiting for the past 6 days (feels like forever) I have finally gotten that magical email from Apple stating that my &#8220;application is ready for sale&#8221;. The application of course referring to a game I created called Buzzword.

Buzzword is essentially a clone of the popular party game CatchPhrase ported on to the iPhone. [ Click Her][1]e for all the details on Buzzword.

I am asking a huge favor to anyone that wants to participate. I will give you a free copy of Buzzword (wow saves you a whole buck) if you would kindly write a review of it on your blog or website. If you are interested, either post a comment in this post, [contact me][2], or hit me up on [Twitter.][3]
