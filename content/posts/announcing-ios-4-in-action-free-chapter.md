Wow, I can’t believe it has been over a year since the release of my book [iPhone And iPad In Action](http://manning.com/trebitowski/). Since then, we have sold over 6,000 copies and have just have released in numerous languages!


As with all iOS (tech books really), my book was almost outdated the moment it hit the shelves due to Apple’s constant SDK release cycle. My book ended with “here is what’s coming in iOS 4…”, and didn’t hit the shelves until after iOS 4 was released.


I was asked last year by [Manning Publishing](http://manning.com) to write the 3rd version of the book to include all of the 4.0 SDK changes. Due to some huge changes in my life, I was unable to accept and they had to find the 4th author to work on the book.


Earlier this month, [Jocelyn Harrington](http://www.manning.com/jharrington/) released the 3rd version of the book titled “iOS 4 In Action”. Here is a bit about this version from their site.



> 
> Written for Xcode 4, iOS 4 in Action guides you from setting up your development environment,  
> 
> through coding your first app, all the way to selling in the App Store. Work through sample  
> 
> applications including a chat client, a video game, an interactive map, background audio,  
> 
> and more as you explore the iOS 4 SDK.
>

Here are some highlights about what’s inside.


* Full coverage of iOS SDK 4.3
* Mastering Xcode 4
* Multitasking for iPhone and iPad
* Game Center, iAd, and AirPrint
* Local and push notification
* Implementing in-app purchasing


This is a significant update and I’m really excited to get my copies in the mail. As soon as I do so, I’ll do a couple giveaways on my blog. Make sure you stick around or [subscribe to the RSS feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/brandontreb) so you don’t miss it!
