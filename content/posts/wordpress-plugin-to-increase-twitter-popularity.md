 If there are two things I love on the intenets, they are [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/brandontreb). Recently there have been many plugins developed to integrate the two. Mainly, updating your Twitter from your blog or vice-versa. But the question is, do these benefit one another?
 



 Does your Twitter send traffic to your WordPress blog or your WordPress blog get you more followers? Maybe if you are [@kevinrose](http://twitter.com/kevinrose) but in my opinion, not really…
 



 I’m currently developing a plugin that will incredibly benenfit your Twitter following using your WordPress blog. It’s called TwitPop and should be available shortly for download. So be sure to [subscribe to the RSS feed](http://feeds2.feedburner.com/brandontreb) and check back soon.
