### The ultimate party game has arrived in the App Store! If you are a fan of the game Catch-Phrase, then you will love Buzzword.

In this fast-paced game, do whatever it takes to get your team to guess the word or phrase. Give them clues &#8211; talk, use your hands, jump around. Once they guess, pass it quick. You don&#8217;t want to be caught with the game at the buzz. </p> 

### Game Controls:

**Start/Stop** &#8211; Starts and stops the timer

**Category **&#8211; Selects a category

**Team1** &#8211; Awards a point to team 1

**Team 2** &#8211; Awards a point to team 2

**Next **&#8211; Selects the next word to describe</p> 

### Game Rules:

<span>To play the game, players need to split up into two teams. </span>You should sit in a circle alternating every other person as a member on your team. 

First, the teams will need to decide on a category in which the words will come from. This is done by pressing the &#8220;Category&#8221; button. Next, pick a team to begin the game with the first word. 

The game starts by pressing the &#8220;start/stop&#8221; button to start the timer. The player holding the iPhone/iPod will try to describe the word on the screen. They can say and do whatever they want without saying any of the words on the screen, saying &#8220;rhymes with&#8221;, or saying &#8220;starts with&#8221;. All of the members on their team will then try to guess the word or phrase the player is trying to describe.

Once the word has been guessed, the iPhone/iPod is passed to the next player on the opposite team. This player will press the &#8220;Next&#8221; button to receive a new word to describe.

The game is played until the buzzer goes off. At this point, the team NOT holding the iPhone/iPod gets a point. This is done by pressing either the &#8220;Team 1&#8221; or &#8220;Team 2&#8221; buttons. The first team to 7 wins!</p>
