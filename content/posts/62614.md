I have recently been experimenting with [Morning Pages](The Artist's Way Morning Pages Journal: A Companion Volume to the Artist's Way <https://a.co/d/aB5Fi7e>) on the recommendation of Tim Ferris.


Iâ€™m not sure that I can stick with it as strongly encourages hand-written pages. My hands cramp up so quickly and I write so small, the journaling takes almost an hour to complete.


*Does anyone have any suggestions on a journaling technique that has worked for you (digital or physical)?*


**Goal**: clear my head
