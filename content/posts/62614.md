I have recently been experimenting with [Morning Pages](The Artist&#39;s Way Morning Pages Journal: A Companion Volume to the Artist&#39;s Way https://a.co/d/aB5Fi7e) on the recommendation of Tim Ferris. 

Iâ€™m not sure that I can stick with it as strongly encourages hand-written pages. My hands cramp up so quickly and I write so small, the journaling takes almost an hour to complete. 

_Does anyone have any suggestions on a journaling technique that has worked for you (digital or physical)?_

**Goal**: clear my head
