[![](/uploads/2010/screenshot.png "Standard Theme")](https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?ii=606601&c=ib&aff=149540&cl=64302)I seem to change my WordPress theme more often than I change my socks. I just tend to get very bored with my blog aesthetics. Not to mention, I will always find someone out there with a cooler blog theme than mine.


After setting up a blog site for the pastor of my church (<http://brownbishop.com>), I fell in love with the [Standard WordPress Theme](https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?ii=606601&c=ib&aff=149540&cl=64302). Not only is the theme absolutely beautiful out of the box, it’s also a theme framework giving you TONS of configuration options including custom layouts, social network integration, and analytics integration. I have seen quite a few amazing blogs built on top of the Standard Theme framework that all look incredible but completely different.


So, I urge you to [check it out](https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?ii=606601&c=ib&aff=149540&cl=64302), It’s kind of pricey ($50), but well worth worth it in my opinion.
