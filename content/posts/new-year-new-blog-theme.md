[<img class="alignleft" title="Standard Theme" src="http://brandontreb.com/wp-content/themes/StandardTheme_20/screenshot.png" alt="" width="300" height="225" />][1]I seem to change my WordPress theme more often than I change my socks. I just tend to get very bored with my blog aesthetics. Not to mention, I will always find someone out there with a cooler blog theme than mine.

After setting up a blog site for the pastor of my church (<http://brownbishop.com>), I fell in love with the[ Standard WordPress Theme][1]. Not only is the theme absolutely beautiful out of the box, it&#8217;s also a theme framework giving you TONS of configuration options including custom layouts, social network integration, and analytics integration. I have seen quite a few amazing blogs built on top of the Standard Theme framework that all look incredible but completely different.

So, I urge you to [check it out][1], It&#8217;s kind of pricey ($50), but well worth worth it in my opinion.
