          Voices That Matter Conference: Highlights
        </a>
      </h1>

      <p>This past weekend, I attended the voices that matter conference as a sponsor for a new product my team is working called <a href="http://maasive.co">MaaSive</a>. We had an absolute blast at the conference and I learned quite a bit from all of the speakers.</p>

<p>Here were a few of my favorite parts:</p>

<h4 id="keynote-by-graeme-devine">Keynote by Graeme Devine</h4>

<p>For those of you who don’t know Graeme is a legend in the game development industry. He was responsible for titles such as Quake 3, 7th guest, and Halo Wars. His presentation entitled “Social Gaming is Dead” was spot on. In it Graeme talked about how game developers have become less focused on the quality of games and more focused on “how do I make a profit?”. A statement that has stuck out to me is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Be generous with fun. We are mean with it!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically, we are charging our users for fun or making them do real work (see Farmville) in order to obtain it. His message was “stop it, make something fun, and dont’t focus on profit”. Otherwise you are <strong>doomed</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/zaphodgjd">Follow Graeme on Twitter</a></p>

<h4 id="moving-to-3d-by-mike-daily">Moving To 3D by Mike Daily</h4>

<p>Mike is a good friend of mine and I look forward to hanging out with him at the conference each year. His talk was all about showing the developers how easy it actually is to create a 3D game without the use of a game engine. Mike’s demo (show below) was an absolutely incredible space shooter where you used the gyroscope to maneuver around.</p>

<p>Mike will be posting a series on <a href="http://www.71squared.com/">his blog</a> in the near future about how to make his game using GLKit in the near future.</p>

<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/31690099">VTM Game Prototype</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/michaeldaley">Michael Daley</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/mikedaley">Follow Mike on Twitter</a></p>

<h4 id="storyboarding-by-erica-sadun">Storyboarding by Erica Sadun</h4>

<p>Erica is an OG (original gangster) when it comes to iOS development. She has been in the space since way before the first SDK was published (in fact she had a jailbroken dev book almost ready to go). Her current book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/iPhone-Developers-Cookbook-Building-Applications/dp/0321659570">The iPhone Developer’s Cookbook</a> is a beast containing almost 900 pages!!!</p>

<p>Her talk showed how easy it is to use storyboarding and just how powerful the technique can be.</p>

<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>

<p>It should be obvious from this post, that the VTM conference was incredible to say the least. If you didn’t attend, I strongly urge you to check out their next one. Hopefully you will get to blog about <em>my</em> talk at it (assuming I get my crap together).</p>

<p>Happy Coding!</p>

          Caterpillar-HD Now In The App Store: Tutorial Series To Follow
        </a>
      </h1>

      <p>I have just released the update to my Centipede clone called <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/caterpillar-hd/id479439790?mt=8">Caterpillar</a>. For those of you who don’t know, I am doing a 6 part series on how to create this game over at <a href="http://mobile.tutsplus.com/tutorials/iphone/building-a-caterpiller-game-with-cocos2d/">MobileTuts+</a>.</p>

<p>This update adds some interesting functionality on which I will be blogging about in the near future.</p>

<p>I have added iAds to my cocos2D project and when the iAds fail to serve (which is about 75% of the time), I replace them with Admob ads. This was achieved by creating a new Admob ad view inside of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">bannerView:didFailToReceiveAdWithError:</code> delegate method.</p>

<p>I will either post a full tutorial about doing this Here or on Mobile Tuts. Either way, I’ll keep you posted.</p>

<p>Also, be sure to <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/caterpillar-hd/id479439790?mt=8">download the game</a>, test it out, and lemme know if you have suggestions. Version 1.1 addressed quite a few issues from feedback (namely poor controls).</p>

<p>Happy coding!</p>

        <a href="/wordpress-to-jekyll-and-back-again">
          WordPress To Jekyll And Back Again
        </a>
      </h1>

      <p>Earlier this year, I jumped ship on WordPress and moved to Jekyll after reading <a href="http://vitobotta.com/how-to-migrate-from-wordpress-to-jekyll/">this post</a> on Hacker News. I wanted to be 1337! I wanted to ditch the whale that was WordPress.</p>

<p>Well, it was quite a run, but in the end I decided to revert back to WordPress. Although Jekyll is <strong>much faster</strong> than WordPress, here were my issues:</p>

<h4 id="build-times">Build Times</h4>

<p>As my post count grew, so did the time to compile my jekyll site. Jekyll is a static site builder, so naturally it has to rebuild your site any time anything changes. With my blog containing hundreds of posts, my site build times started getting into minutes. I simply don’t want to wait forever to publish a post.</p>

<p>Since it took <strong>so long</strong> to build my site, it discouraged me from posting. I would only write posts on my specified <a href="http://idevblogaday.com">#iDevBlogADay</a> days, rather than just posting quick info posts.</p>

<h4 id="too-many-dependancies">Too Many Dependancies</h4>

<p>Jekyll is a beast to install, especially if you want to support some of the fancier plugins like syntax highlighting. This limited my blogging to only <em>my</em> machines. I couldn’t blog from anywhere anymore. I could have installed Jekyll on my server, but that just seems like a hassle, also see my first point about build times.</p>

<h4 id="no-mobile-app">No Mobile App</h4>

<p>I like to blog on the go, and with Jekyll I just couldn’t find an elegant solution to blog from my iPhone or iPad. I found myself trying to come up with hackish solutions and write custom scripps, but in the end it just wasn’t worth it.</p>

<h4 id="i-can-now-use-markdown-with-wordpress">I can now use Markdown with WordPress</h4>

<p>I fell in love with Jekyll because I could write in markdown. With <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/markdown-on-save-improved/">this plugin</a>, I can now do just that with WordPress. It stores the Markdown in a separate meta field and generates the post_content html upon publishing the post. So, I’m not married to the plugin in case I decide to ditch it.</p>

<p>I have also hid the disgusting “Visual Editor” that WordPress is unfortunate enough to ship with. This makes my writing experience much more pleasant.</p>

<h4 id="the-future">The Future</h4>

<p>While Jekyll was a fun experiment, I think I will stick with WordPress for now.</p>

</center>

<p>Earlier this year, I launched an application called <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/smart-lockscreen-creator/id419890996?mt=8">Smart Lockscreen Creator</a>. It was a pretty simple app that allowed you to add dynamic data (such as weather) to your wallpaper and save it back out to your camera roll. The idea is to improve the functionality of the user’s lockscreen. It did very well on launch (and even made it to #1 in the Israel App Store). At the peak, I was selling about 600 copies per day.</p>

<p>Well, the honeymoon period is over and sales have slowed down <strong>quite a bit</strong>, however they have completely stabilized around what I’m calling the “cruising speed”. So, what’s my speed? On an average day, I will sell between 10-15 copies of the application per day. This is with no additional marketing, I’m not on any top 500 pages, and honestly I haven’t done much to the application at all. The app even has ~2 star rating. Not because it sucks, but because people don’t read the description and assume it will constantly update their lockscreen.</p>

<p>I have asked a few developers and this seems to be a fairly common cruising speed. So, now I’m asking you.</p>

<p><strong>What’s YOUR cruising speed?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Do you think updating the application will affect this speed?</strong></p>

<p><strong>What dictates the speed?</strong></p>

<p>I’d love to hear your responses in the comments.</p>
