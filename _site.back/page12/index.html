      <p><img width="540" src="http://ios2011.voicesthatmatter.com/attachments/0002/0659/topright.gif" /></p>

<p>In November, I will be attending the <a href="http://ios2011.voicesthatmatter.com/">Voices That Matter iOS Developers conference</a>. It will be my third time attending, and I can’t recommend it enough. One major change from this year however is, I will be attending as a sponsor. A new company/project (currently in private alpha) will be participating as a sponsor at the conference.</p>

<p>We intend to have a table set up with multiple computers and devices so you can check out our product first hand. Bleh, that sounds kind of spammy. But, we have been working on something incredibly killer and I can’t wait to share it with all of you.</p>

<p><strong>If YOU are planning on attending the conference</strong>, please comment on this post, <a href="http://twitter.com/brandontreb">write me on Twitter</a>, or email me. I’d love to set up a one on one time to give you the full demo.</p>

<p>Also, I’m sure many of you already have a discount code, but if not, I have a pretty sweet promo code for $100!</p>

<h4 id="bstblog">BSTBLOG</h4>

<p>Enter that at checkout. Combining that with the “Early Bird Pricing”, you save $300! Not a bad deal.</p>

<p>So, if you do end up coming (you are crazy not to), please communicate with me. At least to say hi, you don’t <em>have</em> to here my super awesome sales spiel if you don’t want to…</p>

<p>Happy Coding!</p>

          Beginning Jailbroken iOS Development &#8211; Your First Tweak
        </a>
      </h1>

      <p>This is the 3rd installment of my jailbroken iOS development series. If you haven’t already, make sure you read the following tutorials to get up to speed.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://brandontreb.com/beginning-jailbroken-ios-development-getting-the-tools/">Beginning Jailbroken iOS Development – Getting The Tools</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://brandontreb.com/beginning-jailbroken-ios-development-building-and-deployment/">Beginning Jailbroken iOS Development – Building And Deployment</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Today I’m going to show you how to patch any internal Apple method that you want. In this demo, we are going to hook into the init method of Springboard and show a UIAlertView upon starting your phone up. It’s not the <em>coolest</em> of applications, but the design pattern and concepts used can be applied to patching any other internal method of any class.</p>

<h4 id="getting-set-up">Getting Set Up</h4>

<p>In order to create a tweak, you must interface with Saurik’s libsubstrate.dylib dynamic library. This might come packaged with theos, but if not, you need to download a fresh copy. One can be found on this <strong>very spammy</strong> site. <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?2upm53uzzj0488u">Download libsubstrate.dylib</a></p>

<p>Once you have downloaded it, copy it to the folder /opt/theos/lib. This is the folder where you will copy any other dynamic libraries that you might need to use in your application.</p>

<p><strong>The iOS Headers</strong></p>

<p>Most likely, theos came with the iOS headers that you need. If not, you need to obtain them by doing a header dump on the device OR Googling around for them. I suggest the latter as someone else has surely done the work for you. Once you have these headers, you need to put them in the folder /opt/theos/include. For this example you should have a folder in there called Springboard containing all of the Springboard headers.</p>

<h4 id="creating-the-project">Creating The Project</h4>

<p>The process for creating the project is simple. I’m going to assume that you already have all of your environment variables in place that we discussed in the <a href="http://brandontreb.com/beginning-jailbroken-ios-development-building-and-deployment/">last tutorial</a>. If not, you will get errors.</p>

<p>Open the console, cd into the directory where you want to create your application and type the following command to create a new Tweak application.</p>

<div>
  <pre>&lt;code class=’bash’&gt;$THEOS/bin/nic.pl&lt;/code&gt;</pre>
</div>

<p>Now, when prompted select the number <a href="http://cl.ly/1u0l0U0y2I0T1g2s3D0O">5</a> for a tweak. Next, you will enter all of the information about your project. The resulting output should look like this:</p>

<div>
  <pre>&lt;code class=’bash’&gt;NIC 1.0 - New Instance Creator
——————————
  [1.] iphone/application
  [2.] iphone/library
  [3.] iphone/preference_bundle
  [4.] iphone/tool
  [5.] iphone/tweak
Choose a Template (required): 5
Project Name (required): WelcomeWagon 
Package Name [com.yourcompany.welcomewagon]:                 
Author/Maintainer Name [Brandon Trebitowski]: 
MobileSubstrate Bundle filter [com.apple.springboard]: 
Instantiating iphone/tweak in welcomewagon/…
Done.&lt;/code&gt;</pre>
</div>

<h4 id="the-tweaks-file">The Tweaks File</h4>

<p>Once your project has been created, you can open in up in your favorite editor. I prefer TextMate. Theos creates a file for you called Tweak.xm. This is a special file that will run through theos’s preprocessor in order to hook into the classes and methods that you specify. So, rather than us having to write tons of boilerplate/crazy hook code, Theos does that all for us with a nice interface.</p>

<p>By default, EVERYTHING in that file is commented out. It took me longer than I care to admit to figure that out when I created my first Jailbroken iOS app.</p>

<p><strong>The Preprocessor commands</strong></p>

<p>There are a few commands that you need to know in order to hook into a class:</p>

<p><strong>%hook and %end</strong></p>

<div>
  <pre>&lt;code class=’objc’&gt;%hook Springboard
// overwrite methods here
%end&lt;/code&gt;</pre>
</div>

<p>The first command is called %hook followed by the name of the class you are hooking in to. You choose the methods to overwrite within the context of %hook className and %end. In the above code, we are saying that we want to hook into some methods in the SpringBoard class.</p>

<p><strong>%orig</strong></p>

<p>When inside a method, the %orig command will call the original method. You can even pass arguments to the command like this %orig(arg1,arg2). One thing to note is, if you don’t call %orig, the original method will never be called. So, if you hook SpringBoard’s init command and fail to call %orig, SpringBoard will never start and your phone will be unusable until you delete your app via ssh.</p>

<h4 id="hooking-into-springboard">Hooking Into Springboard</h4>

<p>Open up Tweak.xm and add the following code. Don’t worry, I will explain it afterwards.</p>

<div>
  <pre>&lt;code class=’objc’&gt;#import &lt;SpringBoard/SpringBoard.h&gt;

%hook SpringBoard

-(void)applicationDidFinishLaunching:(id)application {
    %orig;
    
    UIAlertView *alert = [[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitle:@"Welcome" 
        message:@"Welcome to your iPhone Brandon!" 
        delegate:nil 
        cancelButtonTitle:@"Thanks" 
        otherButtonTitles:nil];
    [alert show];
    [alert release];
}

%end&lt;/code&gt;</pre>
</div>

<p>OK, so what’s going on here. First, we import the Springboard.h header. This will allow us access to springboard. Next, we tell the preprocessor to hook into the Springboard class.</p>

<p>The method that we are overriding here is the applicationDidFinishLaunching: method. This will of course fire right when SpringBoard starts up. Notice that we make the %orig call. If we omit this, our phone would never boot up properly as SpringBoard needs it’s initialization method.</p>

<p>Finally, we just throw up a UIAlertView. Again, not too exciting, but you get the point.</p>

<h4 id="adding-additional-frameworks">Adding Additional Frameworks</h4>

<p>If you were to type build to build this project at this point you would see an error like this:</p>

<div>
  <pre>&lt;code class=’bash’&gt;Tweak.xm: In function ‘objc_object* $_ungrouped$SpringBoard$init(SpringBoard*, objc_selector*)’:
Tweak.xm:6: error: declaration of ‘objc_object* self’ shadows a parameter&lt;/code&gt;</pre>
</div>

<p>This is because we depend on the UIKit framework to show alerts. In order to tell theos that we want to link in UIKit, we must create an addition to the Makefile. Add the following line to your Makefile.</p>

<div>
  <pre>&lt;code class=’bash’&gt;WelcomeWagon_FRAMEWORKS = UIKit&lt;/code&gt;</pre>
</div>

<p>This will ensure that UIKit gets linked in.</p>

<h4 id="building-packaging-and-installing">Building, Packaging, And Installing</h4>

<p>In the terminal, cd into your project’s directory. At this point, you can type make to simply build your project. Theos has provided a nice way to automatically install your library on your device. In order for it to work you must have the THEOS_DEVICE_IP environment variable set to your iPhone/iPod’s IP address. This is explained in the <a href="http://brandontreb.com/beginning-jailbroken-ios-development-building-and-deployment/">previous tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>In the terminal type:</p>

<div>
  <pre>&lt;code class=’bash’&gt;make install&lt;/code&gt;</pre>
</div>

<p>This will build your tweak and install it on your device. When prompted to enter your password, the default is “alpine”. Also, make sure that SSH is installed on your device.</p>

<p>After installation, your device will respring and you will be greeted with your custom message like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/3J1W0j0c1F3y081P2D2i/IMG_0001.PNG" alt="Jailbroken App Development" /></p>

<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>

<p>You should now have a basic understand of how to patch any method inside of iOS. With this knowledge, you can customize ANYTHING that you don’t like about the device. If you have any questions or comments, feel free to leave them in the comments section of this post.</p>

          10 Great Pixel Art Tutorial And Free Resource Sites For Your Games
        </a>
      </h1>

      <p>I don’t usually create “list” posts, however I wanted to share a grouping of resources I have been collecting over the past few months. As you may have noticed, I’m a bit of a Pixel Art fanatic and wanted to share with you the tutorials that helped to get me started as well as some sites offering some high quality <strong>free</strong> pixel art.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that some of these sites have similar content, however they all take a slightly different approach in teaching. I found it very helpful to read each of the tutorials and learn from different points of view.</p>

<h4 id="1-gas-13--isometric-pixel-art-tutorial">1. Gas 13 – Isometric Pixel Art Tutorial</h4>

<p><img src="http://www.gas13.ru/v3/tutorials/f9.gif" alt="Pixel House" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.gas13.ru/v3/tutorials/isometric_pixelart_tutorial_mathematics_of_isometrics.php">link</a></p>

<p>This was my very first pixel art tutorial. I was amazed at how quickly I was able to make a really professional looking pixel art building. I highly recommend all of the tutorials on this guy’s site. Some of them however can be quite complex.</p>

<h4 id="2-derek-yu--the-pixel-tutorial">2. Derek Yu – The Pixel Tutorial</h4>

<p><img src="http://www.derekyu.com/images/extras/lucha-finished.gif" alt="Wrestler" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.derekyu.com/?page_id=221">link</a></p>

<p>This was another site that I stumbled upon early on in my pixel art quest. Derek provides a nice story telling approach to teaching the in’s and out’s of pixel art. I really appreciated his tutorial on lines.</p>

<h4 id="3-mini-wizard-studios--what-is-isometric-pixel-art">3. Mini Wizard Studios – What is ‘Isometric’ pixel art</h4>

<p><img src="http://www.miniwizardstudios.com/images/pixel/iso/office.gif" alt="Sample pixel art" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.miniwizardstudios.com/iso.asp">link</a></p>

<p>This guy offers another dead simple intro to pixel art. Most of it is just explanation, however his examples are quite good. He shows examples of Backgrounds, Characters, objects, tiles, as well as a ton of different UI elements and icons. It’s a great place to go for some inspiration.</p>

<h4 id="4-hub-pages--how-to-start-with-pixel-art">4. Hub Pages – How To Start With Pixel Art</h4>

<p>The City creator is not so much a tutorial as it is a resource for creating gorgeous pixel cities. It has a nice interface and a <strong>huge</strong> selection of buildings, objects, roads, signs, and trees to go into your city. I am not sure what their license is on the generated cities, however I didn’t see any clause about not reusing the graphics in your own projects.</p>

          Cocos2D Tutorial &#8211; Dynamically Coloring Sprites
        </a>
      </h1>

      <p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/42231G3d1P3d1b3H2Q2g/Screen%20shot%202011-07-30%20at%204.39.28%20PM.png" alt="Custom Bitizens" /></p>

<p>Have you ever seen a game (such as Tiny Tower) that contains similar sprites that only vary by certain attributes (coloring, shading, accessories, etc…)? I would often wonder how long it would take the artists to create each permutation of these sprites. After discovering that you can call a method on a CCSprite called setColor, I realized how most of this customization is done in code.</p>

<p>This tutorial will be a continuation of my last post about <a href="http://brandontreb.com/Pixel-Art-Character-Tutorial-Create-A-Bitizen">creating your own Bitizen in Photoshop</a>. So, if you don’t already have a Bitizen character to work with, I suggest you follow that tutorial OR download my template <a href="http://cl.ly/2u3h0g2F2H2b1S280519/bitizen.psd">here</a>.</p>

<h4 id="white-out">White Out</h4>

<p>As I mentioned above, we are going to be using the setColor method of CCSprite to dynamically color each part of our Bitizen. The way it works is each pixel’s color is multiplied by the value passed into setColor giving it a “tint”. So, pixels that are all white will be fully tinted and pixels that are all black will have no change.</p>

<p>So, our first goal is to create an “all white” version of our Bitizen. Don’t worry about shading for now, I will cover that in a moment. I just started with our Bitizen as a base and created new layers for each of the “white” components.</p>

<p>You should end up with 5 new layers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>white-head</li>
  <li>white-skin</li>
  <li>white-hair</li>
  <li>white-pants</li>
  <li>white-shoes</li>
</ul>

<p>For each layer, trace over the corresponding colored layer. For the “white-skin” layer, make sure to trace over the hands as well as the face. This will ensure that your Bitizen’s color is consistent. When you are done, your Bitizen should look something like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/0Z08222Z1v233i1G3H1o/Screen%20shot%202011-07-30%20at%204.52.03%20PM.png" alt="White Bitizen" /></p>

<p>Looks pretty bland… The next step is to add our shading. We will be using only black with varying alpha in order to achieve the desired shading. So, make sure to play with it a bit and get the shading to your liking. Add a new shading layer for each component (or simply draw on top of the current layer with the black pencil).</p>

<p>Your bitizen should look something like this after doing all of the shading:</p>

<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/3f2P3F1b2Z1y1W0W2V3V/Screen%20shot%202011-07-30%20at%203.47.09%20PM.png" alt="Shaded Bitzen" /></p>

<h4 id="chop-it-up">Chop It Up</h4>

<p>The final thing we need to do with our graphic is chop up the pieces so that they can be individually colored. Convert each of the white-* layers to Smart Objects, copy them to a new document, and save them. You should end up with 5 .png files (head.png,skin.png,hair.png,pants.png,shoes.png).</p>

<p>I increased the size of my Bitizen by 4 before doing this step. You might consider increasing their size as well. Remember that the size increase you choose will change some of the values when we recreate the Bitizen in Cocos2D. So, if you want to follow along, make sure your Bitizen is 60×100 before exporting the various parts.</p>

<p>One thing to note is we are going to bring these into Cocos2D as 5 different sprites. There are some optimizations that you could do using sprite sheets, however I want to make things as clear as possible. So, we are going the long way.</p>

<p><a href="http://cl.ly/1I102a1F2L323C1R2Y2h">You can download my completed white bitizen here</a>.</p>

<h4 id="rebuilding-the-bitizen-in-cocos2d">Rebuilding The Bitizen In Cocos2D</h4>

<p>Once you have imported the 5 Bitizen image files into Cocos2D, you need to reconstruct them in code. This involves adding each sprite to the layer.</p>

<p>Here is the code to display the skin/head+hands in our layer. As a note, I simply created a new Cocos2D project and am using the retina only mode for my display using [director enableRetinaDisplay:YES]. The offsets will change quite a bit if you are choosing to support non-retina.</p>

<div>
  <pre>&lt;code class=’objc’&gt;int spriteX = 240;
int spriteY = 160;

CCSprite *skin = [CCSprite spriteWithFile:@"skin.png"];
[skin setPosition:ccp(spriteX, spriteY)];
[self addChild:skin];&lt;/code&gt;</pre>
</div>

<p>This will draw our white(shaded) head on the screen. That’s pretty boring so let’s draw the rest of the body. Update your code to look like the following:</p>

<div>
  <pre>&lt;code class=’objc’&gt;int spriteX = 240;
int spriteY = 160;

CCSprite *skin = [CCSprite spriteWithFile:@"skin.png"];
[skin setPosition:ccp(spriteX, spriteY)];
[self addChild:skin];

int hairOffset = 11;

CCSprite *hair = [CCSprite spriteWithFile:@"hair.png"];
[hair setPosition:ccp(spriteX, spriteY+hairOffset)];
[self addChild:hair];

int shirtYOffset = -9;
int shirtXOffset = 1;

CCSprite *shirt = [CCSprite spriteWithFile:@"shirt.png"];
[shirt setPosition:ccp(spriteX + shirtXOffset, spriteY+shirtYOffset)];
[self addChild:shirt];

int pantsYOffset = -15;
int pantsXOffset = 1;

CCSprite *pants = [CCSprite spriteWithFile:@"pants.png"];
[pants setPosition:ccp(spriteX + pantsXOffset, spriteY+pantsYOffset)];
[self addChild:pants];

int shoesYOffset = -17;
int shoesXOffset = 1;

CCSprite *shoes = [CCSprite spriteWithFile:@"shoes.png"];
[shoes setPosition:ccp(spriteX + shoesXOffset, spriteY+shoesYOffset)];
[self addChild:shoes];&lt;/code&gt;</pre>
</div>

<p>Now, you should see the lonely ghost of a Bitizen standing in the center of your screen.</p>

<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/090s2v0F1B3d3k3v3V1R/Screen%20shot%202011-07-30%20at%205.10.34%20PM.png" alt="Ghost Bitizen" /></p>

<p>Still boring… Time to spice him up with some color.</p>

<h4 id="tinting-cocos2d-sprites">Tinting Cocos2D Sprites</h4>

<p>As I mentioned before, tinting Cocos2D sprites is very simple. I would recommend keeping all sprites that you wish to tint a shade of white/gray otherwise some crazy things will happen.</p>

<p>The setColor method takes an array of integers from 0-255. This array contains 3 numbers (1st for red, 2nd for green, 3rd for blue). For example, we can pass all <font color="red">Red</font> to the setColor method by sending it {255,0,0}.</p>

<p>Let’s start by tinting our Bitizen’s shirt a random color. Change the code that displays the shirt to look like this:</p>

<div>
  <pre>&lt;code class=’objc’&gt;CCSprite *shirt = [CCSprite spriteWithFile:@"shirt.png"];
[shirt setPosition:ccp(spriteX + shirtXOffset, spriteY+shirtYOffset)];
ccColor3B shirtColor = {arc4random() % 255,arc4random() % 255,arc4random() % 255};
[shirt setColor:shirtColor];
[self addChild:shirt];&lt;/code&gt;</pre>
</div>

<p>Now, every time you run the application, the Bitizen should have a different shirt color. You can apply this principle to each of your sprites to completely customize your Bitizen.</p>

<p>What if you only want to limit certain colors? (you ask). Well, that’s a great question. I solved this by creating an array of ccColor3Bs. Basically an array of arrays. And then I index into this array and set the color accordingly. Here is an example of setting a random skin color to avoid having blue people (unless maybe you are making Smurfs).</p>

<div>
  <pre>&lt;code class=’objc’&gt;ccColor3B skinColors[] = { 
    {247,224,194},
    {255,232,214},
    {136,119,82},
    {245,232,205},
    {144,110,38}
};
CCSprite *skin = [CCSprite spriteWithFile:@"skin.png"];
[skin setPosition:ccp(spriteX, spriteY)];
ccColor3B skinColor = skinColors[arc4random() % 5];
[skin setColor:skinColor];
[self addChild:skin];&lt;/code&gt;</pre>
</div>

<p>I have an array of 5 different arrays and randomly index into it using skinColors[arc4random() % 5]. This will give me a random color within my skin color group.</p>

<p>After running this through a loop and adding random colors to some of the other sprites, I ended up creating the image you see at the top of this post.</p>

<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>

</center>

<p>This will be a continuation of my last pixel art tutorial about <a href="http://brandontreb.com/Configuring-Photoshop-For-Pixel-Art">configuring Photoshop for Pixel Art</a>. For the past month or so, both my wife an I have been pretty addicted to this amazing game called <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tiny-tower/id422667065?mt=8">Tiny Tower</a> created by <a href="http://nimblebit.com/">Nimble Bits</a>. The biggest draw for me to this game isn’t the fact that it has great simulation style game mechanics, it’s the fact that it was created using <strong>Pixel Art</strong>.</p>

<p>As I mentioned in my other post, I have a serious passion for pixel art and have been doing everything I can to learn about it and improve my skills. One great thing about it is, <strong>anyone can do it</strong>. You don’t have to be this amazing artist to be able to create interesting pixel art.</p>

<h4 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h4>

<p>They say that imitation is the best form of flattery, so we are going to flatter the heck out of the Nimble Bits guys are learn how to make our own Bitizen characters from Tiny Tower. I have found that a good starting place for learning pixel art (or anything really), is to start with something that already exists, copy it, then modify it. Once you do that a few times and get comfortable, then you should have the confidence to branch out into creating your own artwork.</p>

<p>When creating a game (or complex piece of pixel artwork) that involves a ton of different characters, it will save a ton of time and energy if you create a “base character”. What I mean by “base character” is one that is very bland and plain. Something that is easily customizable. So, that’s what this tutorial is about, we are going to create a bland white guy for Tiny Tower.</p>

<p>One thing I want to point out before we start is, I have lowered the resolution of the character a bit and am not putting in as much detail as the Nimble Bits team. This is just for simplicity’s sake in order to get my point across and make things easier on you.</p>

<h4 id="new-document">New Document</h4>

<p>Start out by creating a 15x25px document. I know, it’s very small, but we don’t need much. Make sure you have Photoshop <a href="http://brandontreb.com/Configuring-Photoshop-For-Pixel-Art">configured</a> for pixel art. At this point, I’d suggest creating all of the layers for your bitizen. <strong>Why use layers?</strong> you might ask. Great question. Well, in order to quickly modify our base character, we want to have a separate layer for each of his features/body parts. So, create the following layers.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Head</li>
  <li>Mouth</li>
  <li>Hair</li>
  <li>Eyes</li>
  <li>Shirt</li>
  <li>Pants</li>
  <li>Feet</li>
  <li>Arms</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, you can confidently modify any part of your Bitizen without the risk of destroying the rest. As I reference each part below, make sure you switch to the correct layer when drawing.</p>

<h4 id="creating-the-head">Creating The Head</h4>

<p>The head is perhaps the most complicated part of the Bitizen due to its odd shape and shading. The shape is due to the fact that the Bitizen is always looking in the forward direction.</p>

<p>Start with a skin tone color (I have used #f7e0c2) and create a 10 x 6 rectangle in the center of your view like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/211O2O1P37131Q2m2Z2P/Screen%20shot%202011-07-16%20at%201.22.24%20PM.png" alt="Bitizen head" /></p>

<p>Now, that the base head is in place, it’s time to draw the chin and neck. With the same color, indent one pixel in on the bottom and draw straight across. Finally, indent 3 more pixels in, and draw 4 pixels across. This is what your head should look like at this point.</p>

<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/401p2x3t1d1B2n2A1W0Y/Screen%20shot%202011-07-16%20at%201.25.11%20PM.png" alt="Head and Chin" /></p>

<p><strong>Shading</strong></p>

<p>Shading with pixel art is simply a matter of drawing with a darker shade of your main color. With the color chooser in PS and the skin tone still selected, drag the color down to a slightly darker shade and lowlight a 1 pixel line on the right side of the face. In our example the Bitizen is looking to his right, so his left will be shaded.</p>

<p>Then, add some more shading as you see necessary. If you look at mine, I have used a bit of shading to extend the head a little bit.</p>

<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/3y3z2Z1n3f0d3T1h3Q46/Screen%20shot%202011-07-16%20at%201.31.16%20PM.png" alt="Head Shading" /></p>

<p><strong>Hair, Mouth And Eyes</strong></p>

<p>The mouth and eyes are very simple with our Bitizens. The eyes are just single black pixels and the mouth is just a 4 pixel line using a darker shade of the skin tone.</p>

<p>Hair can be whatever you like. I have chosen a very simple hairstyle that you see quite often in the game with a simple shade of brown. I have also applied the same shading technique to the hair that I did to the face and neck. When you are finished, it should really start looking like a person.</p>

<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/2n181w081O20042v3U0g/Screen%20shot%202011-07-16%20at%201.35.22%20PM.png" alt="Hair and eyes" /></p>

<h4 id="creating-the-body-legs-and-feet">Creating The Body, Legs and Feet</h4>

<p>For the body, start with 6 x 5 rectangle set to the color that you want to make the shirt. I chose #63cfea. For the pants, simply draw a solid line. Finally, the feet are just two 2px lines spread apart by two more pixels. If you notice in the game, to animate the movement of these guys, they simply alternate between this position and a centered 4px line. It just goes to show you how much things can be simplified when you use pixel art.</p>

<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/3B203J0j2R3T0p0s3r39/Screen%20shot%202011-07-16%20at%201.43.55%20PM.png" alt="Body and legs" /></p>

<p>To finish up our Bitizen, we add single pixel dots for hands and a couple pixels for arms. After that, we add a collar and some simple shading.</p>

<p>Here is what the completed Bitizen looks like:</p>

<p><img src="http://f.cl.ly/items/0M1F0I0O0F3q3E2n3w0I/Screen%20shot%202011-07-16%20at%201.51.49%20PM.png" alt="Completed Bitizen" /></p>

<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>

<p>The one thing to remember when creating pixel art for game is to keep it simple. Simplify everything. Take for example the Toy Story characters I made at the top of this post. They are <em>very</em> simplistic yet you recognize who they are right away. My 2.5 year old son was yelling “Woody! Buzz!” the entire time I was creating them. I think this is one of the largest challenges; sticking to “less is more”.</p>

<p>There are some other fun things we can do to customize these guys. We can even do it in code! Next time, I will show you how to take a “base character” and customize its colors using Cocos 2D. This can save you even more time and energy when trying to make dynamic characters for your game.</p>

<p>On a final note, <strong>don’t just copy these guys for YOUR game</strong>! I know it might seem tempting to give em a different shirt and plop them in your super rad fart machine RPG, but these guys are the product of the hard work of the guys at Nimble Bits.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or tips, please feel free to leave them in the comments.</p>

<p>I would also <strong>LOVE</strong> to see some of the custom bitizens you guys come up with. Please link to them in the comments if you end up creating some.</p>
