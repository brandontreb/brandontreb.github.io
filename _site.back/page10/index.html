          Why I Went Back To Jekyll &#8211; Also Rackspace Sucks
        </a>
      </h1>

      <p>Recently, I was pretty humbled when a post of mine titled <a href="http://brandontreb.com/wordpress-to-jekyll-and-back-again/">WordPress To Jekyll And Back Again</a> made it to the front page of Hacker News. I was a little down on Jekyll for the reasons listed in that post and was feeling pretty good about my WordPress install.</p>

<p>At the time, I was running my own virtual instance on Rackspace cloud hosting (we’ll get to this momentarily). I also had all of the caching and optimization plugins installed and welcomed the Hacker News traffic.</p>

<p>As you can imagine, the influx of HN traffic crashed the server multiple times and I was (with good reason) mocked in the comments (“must be because he’s ‘back to WordPress’”). So, I asked for advice and further “beefed up” my setup switching from Apache to Nginx, upping the ram, and switching caching plugins. WordPress is a beast and hard to optimize. That’s not even the kicker as to why I switched away.</p>

<h4 id="a-call-from-rackspace">A Call From Rackspace…</h4>

<p>About a month ago, I realized my blog was down. I figured that it might have been that I was featured somewhere else which was crashing it (again I was rolling my eyes at WordPress). But then, I got a call and email from a <em>very</em> helpful Rackspace employee. The email went like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Despite the very best efforts of or our Engineering and Datacenter Operations Teams, unfortunately the host machine that your cloud server ‘Websites’ resides on was not able to be recovered. At this point, we are looking at complete data loss.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and… Rackspace, in this poorly phrased email, was basically like. “Well, sucks to be you, hope you had a backup!”. Well, I admit this is partially my fault for not having a backup as I am a bit of a n00b when it comes to server admin, but I had been hosting for years on (don’t judge me) GoDaddy before that and a couple years on Rackspace. I had no idea that hosting companies didn’t have backups of their own. It would seem that this might be crucial to their business.</p>

<p>Needless to say, I lost everything including a jewelry site that I ran (not many sales), an iPhone leaderboard site (not very popular), 2 of my buddies WordPress blogs, and my current WordPress blog.</p>

<h4 id="jekyll-to-the-rescue">Jekyll To The Rescue</h4>

<p>I was pretty angry at Rackspace and myself for never making a backup, but then it hit me that <em>most</em> of my posts had been converted to Jekyll and were backed up in a github repository. I was able to restore my blog within a few minutes (now hosted on GitHub) and recover the WordPress posts from the <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/brandontreb">Feedburner cache</a> of my site.</p>

<p>As for my buddies’ sites… I feel for them <img src="http://brandontreb.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<h4 id="new-list-of-why-jekyll-is-awesome">New List Of Why Jekyll Is Awesome</h4>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Automatically backed up</strong> – This is huge. If not for switching to Jekyll at one point, I would have lost <strong>years</strong> worth of content. If you have every tried to back up WordPress, it’s a huge frackin pain since the database dump usually gets HUGE.</li>
  <li><strong>Free To Host</strong> – I’m not sure why I was so stubborn about doing my own hosting. I am now hosting on <a href="https://github.com/brandontreb/brandontreb.github.com">GitHub</a> and it couldn’t be more stable and fast.</li>
  <li><strong>Mobile Blogging</strong> – This was my largest gripe about Jekyll. I was jealous that I couldn’t blog from my iPhone like WordPress users. Well, I have found a pretty decent solution (tutorial to follow), which involves a combo of Prompt, Screen, and Vim.</li>
  <li><strong>Content Oriented</strong> – WordPress makes it super easy to dump tons of images into your posts. While blogging with Jekyll (inside of Vim in my case), it’s a little bit more of a pain to add your own images. That being said you must be choosy forcing you to focus more on the content and less on using visual crutches.</li>
  <li><strong>Blog Anywhere</strong> – This was another limitation I was placing on Jekyll in my last post. However, I just wasn’t using Jekyll to its full potential. I was building my site locally and rsyncing it up to my server. This process was a little tedious and discouraged me from writing many new posts. Now, hosting with github, posting is as simple as a quick push to the repo.</li>
  <li><strong>Ninja Fast</strong> – This one should be obvious.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>

<p>I am quite happy blogging with Jekyll. As far as I’m concerned there is no reason to ever host my own blog again (as long as Github doesn’t ditch pages 😉 ). Also, if you currently have stuff on Rackspace, <strong>go make a backup now</strong> (or ditch them altogether). Thanks for reading and <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/brandontreb">look out</a> for my next post about mobile blogging with Jekyll.</p>

<p>Happy Blogging!</p>

          New Year &#8211; New Theme: Focus On The Content
        </a>
      </h1>

      <p>As you may have noticed, my blog has a new (much cleaner) theme. For 2012, my blogging goals are to focus much more on content rather than flashy visuals.</p>

<p>I have also minimized my set up to save blogging costs (I now blog for FREE) and to simplify things greatly. Here is my new setup:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> as my “blog engine”</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.wptux.com/206/wp-typo">The WPTypo WordPress Theme</a> I ported this to Jekyll</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/brandontreb/brandontreb.github.com">GitHub</a> for hosting (it’s free).</li>
  <li>Vim – I’m using this as my “blog editor”. There are some incredible plugins that I am using to help facilitate blogging using Jekyll (post on how I do this to follow)</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s about it. I am now free from server costs and my blog is <strong>always</strong> backed up and easily accessible.</p>

<p>2011 has been a very successful year in terms of blogging for me. In addition to writing here and on <a href="http://icodeblog.com">iCodeBlog</a>, I have recently started blogging for Mobile Tuts + on the <a href="http://envato.com">Envato Network</a>. You can check out my 7 part game series on creating a caterpillar game using Cocos2D <a href="http://mobile.tutsplus.com/series/build-a-caterpillar-game-with-cocos2d/">here</a>.</p>

<p>I can’t wait to start posting some great content in this new year. Given my new setup, I literally have to adhere to the title of this post as blogging in VIM doesn’t really lend itself to visuals ;).</p>

<p>Happy New Year and Happy Hacking in 2012!</p>

      <p>From the first time I saw this effect in the Tweetie (now <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/twitter/id333903271?mt=8">Twitter for iPhone</a>), I was crazy about it. I had written my own hacks to make something <em>close</em>, but it was always terrible. Within the past few months, I have been using a perfect/elegant solution to this problem called <a href="https://github.com/samvermette/SVProgressHUD">SVProgressHUD</a>.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p><img src="https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com/img/07e5ce2827299e152cd8f57ebb6eecf7ce9feedd/687474703a2f2f662e636c2e6c792f6974656d732f32333159324130743074314a30423072334e30702f737670726f6772657373687564332e706e67" width="550" /></p>

<p>Using this in your project is as easy as calling:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <div class="code">
    <pre class="objc" style="font-family:monospace;"><span style="color: #11740a; font-style: italic;">// showing</span>

      <p><img alt="" src="https://github.com/tcurdt/iProxy/raw/master/Documentation/screenshots/screen12.png" title="iProxy" class="alignright" height="340" /></p>

<p>With all of the buzz around the <a href="http://tether.com">iTether</a> App, I figured I’d offer a more permanent solution since Apple will surely yank this soon</p>

<p>Last year, a developer published his code for an http <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOCKS">SOCKS</a> proxy called iProxy. This will give your iPhone the ability to create a SOCKS server in which your laptop can connect to via the Bonjur protocol.</p>

<p>Once connect, all of your computer’s http traffic will be routed through the server on your iPhone essentially giving you <strong>free tethering</strong>. Since this isn’t using the iPhone’s built-in tethering method, I’d assume At&amp;t could not detect it*. After looking at the code, it becomes pretty obvious how the SOCKS proxy works and makes me kick myself that I didn’t write it (or find this code sooner).</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/tcurdt/iProxy/wiki/Configuring-iProxy">setup</a> is a little complex, but you only need to do it once. I would love to hear in the comments if any of you has had some experience with this. I will also share my own as soon as I can get it installed later today.</p>

<p>Download the project over at <a href="https://github.com/tcurdt/iProxy">github</a>.</p>

<p>Happy Coding!</p>

          Caterpillar 1.1 Released
        </a>
      </h1>

      <p>I have just released the update to my Centipede clone called <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/caterpillar-hd/id479439790?mt=8">Caterpillar</a>. For those of you who don’t know, I am doing a 6 part series on how to create this game over at <a href="http://mobile.tutsplus.com/tutorials/iphone/building-a-caterpiller-game-with-cocos2d/">MobileTuts+</a>.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>This update adds some interesting functionality on which I will be blogging about in the near future.</p>

<p>I have added iAds to my cocos2D project and when the iAds fail to serve (which is about 75% of the time), I replace them with Admob ads. This was achieved by creating a new Admob ad view inside of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">bannerView:didFailToReceiveAdWithError:</code> delegate method.</p>

<p>I will either post a full tutorial about doing this Here or on Mobile Tuts. Either way, I’ll keep you posted.</p>

<p>Also, be sure to <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/caterpillar-hd/id479439790?mt=8">download the game</a>, test it out, and lemme know if you have suggestions. Version 1.1 addressed quite a few issues from feedback (namely poor controls).</p>

<p>Happy coding!</p>
