          I Suck At Blogging (Lately)
        </a>
      </h1>

      <p>OK, so the title isn‚Äôt entirely true (I have maintained quite a few blogs in my day). But, one thing is for sure, I have sucked at blogging <strong>lately</strong>. So much so, I just had to think hard about having to bold lately using markdown in the previous sentence <em>#meta</em>.</p>

<h4 id="burnout">Burnout</h4>

<p>I was blogging very consistently for the <a href="http://envato.com">Envato Network</a> on their <a href="http://mobile.tutsplus.com">Mobile Tuts Plus</a> as well as on <a href="http://icodeblog.com">iCodeBlog</a> and here. Eventually, I got burnt out and gave up blogging on every blog (for the month).</p>

<p>What happened was, I was blogging to make money (Envato pays $250/post!) and no longer for fun. This sucks and I was missing deadlines and writing crappy content which needed much revision.</p>

<h4 id="new-plan">New Plan</h4>

<p>Write here only (for fun!) and infrequently on icode if time permits as I can do that during work time üòâ That being said, expect to see more content here for better or worse. Once a week is the new goal.</p>

<h4 id="shutup">Shutup</h4>

<p>That‚Äôs what you are saying to me. I hate these ‚ÄúSorry I haven‚Äôt been around in a while. I promise to post more‚Äù posts that are usually the last posts on a blog for like 5 years just as much as you do. Let‚Äôs hope that‚Äôs not the case here. You will just have to trust me and <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/brandontreb">subscribe</a>.</p>

<p>Also, I have a sweet new theme from <a href="http://jekyllbootstrap.com/">Jekyll Bootstrap</a>.</p>

          Vim For iOS Is Incredible

      </h1>

      <p>I used to be an Emacs guy and would battle to the death on the war between Vim and Emacs. It wasn‚Äôt until a coworker of mine sat down and really showed me just how cool/simple/powerful Vim can be. Just using Vim is a new adventure every day and has really improved my productivity. I now use it to code, blog, and even jot down quick notes.</p>

<p>Last week, I saw on Hacker News a link announcing <a href="http://applidium.com/en/applications/vim/">Vim has been ported to iOS</a>. I have spent a week or so with it and can honestly say the port is almost perfect!</p>

<p><img src="http://applidium.com/en/applications/vim/overview.jpg?13270539" width="400" /></p>

<p>It has <em>most</em> of the major Vim features and commands including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Automatic indentation</li>
  <li>Visual mode (block operations)</li>
  <li>Language-aware syntax highlighting</li>
  <li>Integrated scripting language that lets you extend functionalities</li>
  <li>Macros recording and playback</li>
  <li>Markers management (to quickly move around the edited file)</li>
  <li>Multiple clipboards</li>
</ul>

<p>You even have access to the config file to remap keys and define your own custom macros.</p>

<p>There are a few features that would make this better on mobile however:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Dropbox Support ‚Äì Currently you must use iTunes to work with Vim documents on mobile. There needs to be an easier way to share these.</li>
  <li>Keyboard bar ‚Äì Since you have to switch modes so frequently and there are some keys you type often ( ‚Äú:‚Äù ), it would be nice to have quick access to these.</li>
  <li>Plugin support ‚Äì This is an Apple limitation <img src="http://brandontreb.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/frownie.png" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></li>
  <li>NERDTree ‚Äì The file browser that‚Äôs built in doesn‚Äôt work too well.</li>
</ol>

<p>With Vim mobile, you can now look <em>even more</em> nerdy on your iPhone üòâ</p>

          Fluid For Mac
        </a>
      </h1>

      <p>As of OSX Lion, I have started to seriously loathe some of the build-it Mac apps (such as Mail, and iCal). While I previously had no issues with them, they now seem to be very clunky and crash quite often. Being a developer, I thought ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt I write an app that wraps web apps for you so you basically get ‚Äúnative web apps‚Äù that have icons and are launchable?‚Äù.</p>

<p>After a quick Google search, I realized <strong><a href="http://fluidapp.com/">this already exists!</a></strong>. The app is called Fluid and it does an incredible job of what I described above and more.</p>

<p><img src="http://fluidapp.com/images/dock_large.png" width="400" /></p>

<p>Here are the feature highlights.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Create a ‚Äúnative‚Äù Mac app for any web app</li>
  <li>Custom icon for each ‚Äúnative‚Äù app you create</li>
  <li>Full screen mode</li>
  <li>User scripps. These are my favorite. They allow you to update the badge count based on information in the browser. See below for a sample user script.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Sample User Script For Twitter</strong></p>

<div>
  <pre>&lt;code class=‚Äôjavascript‚Äô&gt;(function () {
        if (window.fluid) {
            setInterval(function updateBadge() {
                var counts = /\d+/.exec(document.title);
                if (counts &amp;&amp; counts[0] &gt; 0) {
                    window.fluid.dockBadge = counts[0] &gt; 99 ? ‚Äò99+‚Äô : counts[0];
                } else {
                    window.fluid.dockBadge = ‚Äù;
                }
            }, 2000);
        }
    })();&lt;/code&gt;</pre>
</div>

<p><a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/review/88425">Source</a></p>

<p>Fluid is free with some minimal features, but I urge you to drop the $4.99 to gain full screen mode and user scripts. It‚Äôs well worth it. I am not affiliated with them in any way, just a happy customer.</p>

          Amazon &#8211; A Terrible Solution To A Huge Problem
        </a>
      </h1>

      <p>tl;dr; Don‚Äôt buy a Kindle Fire for your kid until they resolve the parental control issues. Wifi password protection is their current solution, and it sucks.</p>

<p>Like many parents, I thought it would be a good idea to get a tablet device for my son so that he could play some <em>educational</em> games and watch some Netflix (in moderation of course). After doing quite a bit of research, I settled on the Kindle Fire. Before the Apple fanboys give me crap, know that I am one, I have an iPad, it‚Äôs too expensive for my son.</p>

<p>Honestly, I really love the fire. I think it has the <em>least terrible</em> Android interface of any of the devices. It‚Äôs intuitive and my 3 year old was able to grasp navigation right away. In addition to navigation, he quickly figured out how to acquire new content (apps, video, children‚Äôs books) thanks to Amazon‚Äôs ‚ÄúOne-Click Ordering‚Äù. Obviously, Amazon thought the process they use on the web transfered well to a tablet device and was not willing to compromise on that. That‚Äôs neither here nor there. You can find plenty of posts about user‚Äôs complaining about the <strong>initial</strong> lack of parental controls.</p>

<h4 id="the-update">The Update</h4>

<p>Shortly after receiving some pretty rough reviews for their interface, Amazon rolled out their first update which brought us to 6.2.1. In addition to fixing some of there terribly choppy UI, they rolled out their ‚Äúfix‚Äù for the lack of parental controls.</p>

<p>I noticed a new security setting that I had hoped would allow the device to require a password for content purchase, but it turns out the setting is to password protect enabling wifi.</p>

<p><strong>Password protect enabling wifi? Really?</strong></p>

<p>This is laughable at best. What a worthless feature. I could not figure out why anyone would ever want that. And then I had a conversation with ‚Äútech support‚Äù.</p>

<h4 id="their-solution-confirmed">Their ‚ÄúSolution‚Äù Confirmed</h4>

<p>After seeing an email from Amazon the other day showing my purchase for $17.99 for Team Umizoomi Season 1 (whatever the crap that is), which obviously my son purchased, I set out to chat with customer support. The conversation went something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚Ä¶</p>

  <p><strong>Me:</strong> Refund!? No parental controls!</p>

  <p><strong>Outsourced Guy:</strong> Enable Wifi Password = protection!</p>

  <p><strong>Me:</strong> No, watch Netflix! Browse Web! Stupid Solution</p>

  <p><strong>Outsourced Guy:</strong> Yes Netflix Need Wifi. Did I solve your problem?</p>

  <p><strong>Me:</strong> ?</p>

  <p><strong>Outsourced Guy:</strong> Phone Number. Call Video Support</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So there you have it. Amazon actually pushes this as their solution to the lack of parental controls. My suspicions were confirmed by Outsourced Guy.</p>

<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>

<p>It‚Äôs sad that a huge company such as Amazon feels that <em>their process</em> is more important than listening to their customers. Although their devices have been selling like <em>fire</em> (badum ch!), they need to address such gaping issues if they are to maintain their edge in the ‚Äúaffordable‚Äù tablet space. Especially as the younger generations start embracing the technology.</p>
